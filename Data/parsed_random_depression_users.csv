If I tell you my secrets, you can tell me yours 

Even if you don’t, the fact I opened that door and trusted you means something to me, and even if you didn’t reciprocate 

It’s a pattern reflected in many things","I have serious issues with maladaptive daydreaming, and the scenarios are almost always with me being rejected and/or with abandonment themes 
Sometimes it’s a constant “movie” playing in the pauses between other things that draw my attention, and it feels like I’m just watching myself be seen as inferior, or humiliated, or blown off, ignored, left behind, cheated on... sometimes being the one who leaves after being hurt... over and over and over

Any dark thought that has a basis in reality and connection to my life becomes a visual loop or set of them","DAE feel intensely loyal to people you have come to trust... until you don’t for whatever reason...

and then it’s like an off switch?","That’s an option, but it’s not something I really want right now... or at least I haven’t given it much thought","I think it is helping me grow, but it’s in small ways.
My aim and goals are for self improvement, but if I was able to ask for anything, I’d be being utilized sexually more often, and the feeling that the D/s dynamic was being mutually fostered would be a lot stronger and would feel secure...like something to depend on not fluctuating, shifting, shrinking or disappearing.
I think what is missing is a deeper understanding of what it feels like to fully engage in the role, and why people do this at all.

I have an optimistic view of what growth is possible, but that view is based on the willingness to participate in earnest, and to come to the table with curiosity and a thirst for these experiences, and not assume much, if anything, about previous ideas or misconceptions...
That can be a tall order for some, but that is the struggle I feel I’m facing","I think he has not yet fully taken his position, meaning not fully stepped into it and gotten comfortable with the “controls” and I think he also does not fully understand the potential for pleasure and personal growth...

I wouldl love to hear about them... I am also looking to give my Dom some ideas :),I feel sad that he probably was killed,"I feel claiming is very important 

to me, anyway","It can be anything that either your Dom does, or says, or that you do,  or say to yourself, that puts you in the mental space of kneeling, surrender, willingness

I didnt spend the entire time on my phone, and I interacted with people. It might not be much to some on the outside world, but I felt good about it.

Draco was a dick and he laughed at almost everyone else besides he himself. Also, he had no reasoning to back himself up. So his statement was really just nothing.
2. Hagrid never said that he disliked Hufflepuff if I remember correctly. He was just saying a general opinion people had about Hufflepuff, and it was a stereotype rather than a fact.
3. Rowling is a bitch on this.
4. Yeah indeed. But so what? Hufflepuff don't really care about winning the house cup that much. 
5. It's for the plot so later Justin could doubt Harry. But he came around. I daresay the snake went for Justin was because dude was hot, even a snake couldn't resist the urge to kiss him.
6. Many people accused Harry to be the Heir of Slytherin...people were terrified and people do crazy things out of fear and the feeling of powerlessness. It was natural. 
7. Nope it was because Cedric was a true Hufflepuff.
8. Harry was shocked when he discovered that the other two schools were cheating. And Cedric too. They both thought that the Triwizard Tournament was played fair and square until the dragon task. Then Cedric decided to return a favor. Meaning he was fair. 
9. Yeah he was, but to Voldemort almost everyone else besides Harry and Dumbledore were spares... so he was just one of them, doesn't mean anything.
10. According to GOF, it says, ""...even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory (was it a ghost? It looked so solid) emerged in its entirety from the end of Voldemort's wand. (Ch 34, Priori Incantatem) So he did come back and if you read the chapter again he supported Harry, though Harry wasn't sure if he was a ghost because he looked so real.
11. Well there's not much to analyze but as a matter of fact she could produce a Patronus so I suppose she wasn't that bad.
12. And Remus died too...and there were many Gryffindor died too...
13. Yeah, but that's the duty of a house ghost, isn't it? To be there for his house and he did.
14. He was, but that doesn't represent Hufflepuff traits.
15. Story wise, after Cedric died, it was Rowling who never considered to give a Hufflepuff an arc so who could be there really? Yeah her fault.
16. Yeah I know. That's on Harry. He decided to ignore Hufflepuffs. Bad Harry.

Overall, as a Hufflepuff, I disagree with you. :)",My answer is always a phoenix egg if case you wonder :),"If he'd made a few before he confronted Voldy in the forest, then the whole Horcrux hunt would've became meaninglessly complicated because Harry could never completely die now unless Voldy found Harry's horcruxes and destroyed them first. But if you're talking about post-war Harry making Horcruxes then let's face it it's even impossible to even imagine that because Harry wanted to die a natural death."

Have a great day!","Don’t take everything I wrote literal. You are a beautiful person. No one (should) care how you look. You seem like a very nice and great friend. So - sorry for the f word - STOP FUCKING DOUBTING YOURSELF!!!! 

Also this:

No one will love you,
Until you love yourself.
No one can complete you,
Until you... yourself are complete.
Famous words, but what does it mean?
You must get to the place
Where you don’t NEED another,
But you can enjoy another without attachment.
Where you can give love...
Without the need of receiving it back.
LOVE without conditions.
You are not you plus the other person.
You existed before the other person
And you will exist long after...
You will always be yourself
And knowing that
You can give more.
When it comes to love and relationships
You can think of it like a mirror.
If you love yourself...
You will find more people that have love for you.
If you respect yourself...
You will find more people that respect you.
If you value yourself...
You will find more people that value you.
If you are mostly happy, joyful and positive 
You will find you attract mostly happy, joyful and positive people and relationships.
So don’t focus on finding someone to complete you...
Focus on completing yourself first.
Then,
the right people will show up.
If you do the work on you...
If you become the person you want in your life...
It will happen for you and you’ll be thankful you didn’t give up.
Believe that.
Love is the most powerful force on earth.
Some say that finding a genuine connection today is harder than ever,
but that’s no reason to give up trying.
That’s no reason to give up believing.
Knowing this,
Real love Will Find you,
When you’re ready for it.
Real love will find you,
when you’re ready for it.
Real love will find you,
when you understand that you don’t search for love in others 
but you find it in yourself first.
We all deserve to be loved,
and the first step on the journey to real love,
Is to LOVE YOURSELF first.
Next, you will need to do the work rather than waiting for someone else to come along and “fix” you,
And finally, now it’s time to let go of the habits that have kept you from getting hurt, but are also holding you back from a true relationship built on love and respect.
So, if you’re asking: “will I ever find love?”
You MUST stop doing these 5 things first:
Number 1:
You have to stop looking for others to love you, and instead love yourself first!
The very first step must be loving oneself first.
If you don’t love the special being you are,
How can you expect anyone else to?
If you are looking for a true partner to share your life with,
Someone who will walk with you and encourage you to live your best life,
You have to treat yourself that way first!
When you find yourself frustrated in your search for a loving and respectful partner,
take a step back to examine how you honestly feel and treat yourself.
Take a close look at your self-talk,
and begin to shut down the negativity that we often inflict ourself.
When you aren’t at peace with who you are and you are constantly waiting for someone to “fix” you,
You will likely attract toxic people who are looking for someone to take advantage of.
Don’t fall into this trap.
Take the time to do the difficult self-work
that makes you an attractive partner 
and will help you to attract loving and respectful people into your life.
When you want someone else to do the heavy lifting for you you will likely be disappointed with the caliber of people who enter your life.
When you know that you are a whole and complete person who is looking for a partner rather than a savior
you are opening yourself up to attracting
like-minded people who are also seeking someone to walk the journey of life with.
Number 2.
Stop wearing masks and trying to appear perfect.
Be yourself!
The most common mistake people make when looking for a real connection is inauthenticity.
True love will never find you if you aren’t ready to reveal your true self.
If you want someone to love you despite your faults, you must be ready to do the same for them.
‘False advertising’ has never been higher.
Tinder, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram are all at times authenticity killers.
People seem more obsessed with appearing “perfect” than ever before.
If you want love, be yourself.
Your raw, true, authentic self, flaws and all
Learn to love who you are and stop hiding it from the world.
One day someone will fall for who you are,
not how you wish to be perceived.
If you’re always wearing a mask,
covering up your REAL SELF...
How could anyone ever love you for who you are?
Remember:
The right person is always waiting for you to reveal your real self.
And the wrong people will always be available for the masked you.
Most people don’t learn this until much later in life, so start expressing your true character today because you never know who’s watching.
Number 3.
Stop expecting someone to be something you are not giving back.
This is the concept in the mirror.
Most people aren’t actively looking for someone who is negative, pessimistic, lazy or uninspiring.
You set the standard for the type of person you want in your life.
If you want a particular type of person,
You must mirror that quality.
If you want someone for and healthy.
You must be a mirror of that person.
You want someone who always sees the positive? Mirror that mindset with your own outlook.
If you want someone with drive and ambition, ask YOURSELF if you possess those characteristics.
Like attracts like, mirror the person you want and that connection will happen much more naturally.
Finding genuine happiness within yourself,
is one of the most important steps to making a genuine connection with someone else.
Number 4.
Stop hiding.
Nothing will come to you in this life if you are hiding from it.
Nothing will come if you are running.
If you want something, you’re gonna have to be brave and put yourself out there.
If you don’t put yourself out there no one will be able to find you.
Sure, this won’t work for you EVERY time...
But it will NEVER work if you never put yourself out there.
Become someone capable of loving and being loved.
Work on yourself so you become better.
Because the better you feel about you,
The better you are going to show up in the real world.
The better you show up, the better your relationships.
Number 5.
Stop holding on to comfortable habits 
that are holding YOU back.
There are a lot of habits that you know don’t serve you well.
But you’ve become comfortable with the perceived protection that they offer.
Habits that you know aren’t helpful in your quest to find true love.
But you may be reluctant to give them up.
If you want to find love you have to make sacrifices.
If this is your situation, remember that lives greatest growth comes when you leave your comfort zone.
Don’t let feeling comfortable and safe hold you back from a full and vibrant life that could lead to the love of your LIFE.
Opening yourself up and allowing emotional vulnerability is an essential part of finding true love.
Let go of the defense mechanisms and withdrawal strategies that have kept you from getting hurt and also hold you back from finding love.

Do you recognize yourself in some of these 5 things?
If you do, it’s time to get down to the hard work that is necessary to get you to a place where you can attract true love.
Yes, it may be scary to let go of these behaviors and mindsets that have protected you from emotional hurt, 
but if you truly want to find love, 
you really have no choice...
Let your light shine brightly,
Bravely be yourself 
and like moths to a flame,
You will attract the right people.
Make sure you mirror the characteristics you find important
And you. Will. Find. LOVE.
And never forget:
No one will love you until you love yourself.","You don’t have to change, just accept who you are!

Self love is hard. Society and media teach us that we should look a certain way to be acceptable or worthy. This sadly makes us think and feel horrible things about ourselves and others, solely based on outer appearances. It’s awful, and it’s really hard to escape this mindset when it’s engrained in our heads. I can share about what I did, as well as some other thoughts:

First off: realize that body size says nothing about us. You can’t tell anything about individuals from simply looking at them- you can make assumptions, but the size of one’s body doesn’t tell you if that person exercises, what he/she ate for breakfast, how much money he/she has, if that person is mean or nice, etc. Some people live in bigger bodies, even if they exercise a ton and eat well. I think really thinking about this and understanding it helped me and how I view myself.

I was just so mad at the world and had a lot of anger I needed to release. I started boxing, so that I could expel this bent up frustration. I didn’t do it with the intention of losing weight- I truly only did it for my mental health and to clear my headspace. As time went on, I realized how much physically stronger I was becoming as a result of the sport. I developed this mindset of making my own version of strong- mentally and physically-and just wanted to improve. One day I looked in the mirror, and I didn’t immediately think negative thoughts- this was the beginning of my self love journey. I changed my overall desire of wanting my body to be smaller and the focus of losing weight to becoming a mentally and physically strong man. Because that’s the type of person that can stand up and break the cycle, and that’s what I wanted to do.

So, I can’t give a step by step here on how to love yourself. I don’t think it’s a one size fits all equation. I will say that any exercise I do is 100% for my mental health. I don’t really think about my body physically anymore.

Another thing: I don’t know your personal situation and if you have a significant other or not- but I think a big misconception is that a solution to finding self peace and self love is to find a partner that can give this to you, eg. a SO who tells you you’re beautiful and look amazing and doesn’t care about bodies. While this type of support is important, it is NOT the SOLUTION for individuals to love themselves. It needs to come after individuals can begin to have peace with their bodies.

Overall, I would encourage you to explore activities and find things to do or think of memories that make you proud of who you are and that make you happy. Or if there’s a goal you want to achieve (like for me this was getting stronger), now’s the time to start working towards that. And when you achieve things you’re proud of, no matter how big or small, give yourself a pat on the back and really recognize that you just accomplished this thing and how awesome it is that you were able to do it. You did it- your head, brain, heart, and body. Because the body you have allows you to do incredible things and you need to celebrate it! We should all do this, to validate ourselves and recognize our bodies for everything they accomplish.

Have a great day! Hope I helped :D",Laughs in metric system,"I write down how I feel...

1) I am fighting with the man in the mirror,
If only I could see him clearer.

He won't see the next tomorrow.
Nothing can help him, 
I leave it be
Until I realize,

2) Everything will be okay,
I have always liked the night 
more than the day.
I will be happy to live in the endless night,
without stars 
or without light.
I will sleep forever,
But forget me never.

3) I drown in my tears
I’ve been left here for years
Chocking in all my fears.

I cry all alone.
I just wanna leave.

trtthings,"Has anybody experienced this and resolved this? Sometimes brought on by sex, sometimes by working out, sometimes nothing.",Interesting to hear about the caber. Do you feel like that helped with your mood swings and what's your dosage of that?,"If so, what's your story with these two? Why'd you get on, and what benefits do you see?

I have some 100mg pregnenolone tabs at home that I've been meaning to try.",What is your protocol / how did you dial it in? I suffer from terrible mood swings as well.,Can you elaborate a bit more on your symptoms prior to starting cabergoline?,">I have not been on trt.  Truth be said my testosterone was on the low side of normal prior to surgery.  The weight loss and exercise were contributors to the testosterone gains.  Part of the reason I didn't go on treatment is I have a phobia of sleeping with a cpap mask.It is actually hillarious to me, I can tolerate surgery with anesthetic, but I cannot tolerate a mask.  I lose weight to try to shake sleep apnea, so I could start trt.  I started to feel a ton better. My testosterone bounced back. Didn't need trt. My libido went nuts, had controlled hypersexuality, so I dumped that stress into exercise.  Thanks to this tumor, in on the best shape of my life?!?!

Hi,

Can you elaborate a bit more on your symptoms prior to starting cabergoline?",Have you gotten a blood test yet to see your free test + E2?,"If you're feeling good I wouldn't change the anastrozole. Out of curiosity, what is your dosage of HCG and anastrozole? If it's a whole tab then it's probably 2 mg a week (which is hefty, but again if it works..). Could you let me know?","I feel the same after coffee so I quit that a while ago. It has an impact on stomach acid secretion for one thing. 

One thing I find helpful for bloating (though bloating has gone way down for me over time with diet) is Betaine HCL + Pepsin. Adds to your stomach acid helps break down proteins especially (the pepsin) and other things as well before it hits the small intestine. 

Just need to be careful not to overdo it, but even if you do it will bounce back and you will learn how it works.","I'm not a doctor but do you have any other symptoms? Fatigue? Heartburn? And the belly bloating, is it in the stomach (upper part/discomfort/burping?). 

For the bowel movement regardless of everything else I'd recommend magnesium hydroxide, 500-1500mg in the morning, and magnesium calm, 1-3 tsp. at night, until the bowel movements are regular. 

For the bloating I'd recommend finding out what foods agree/disagree with you. I eat gluten free personally but that's for other reasons. I also found that high-fiber (uncooked vegetables, etc.) don't agree too well with me, but that's better with the magnesium.

So, anecdotally brain fog is a very common complaint in hypothyroidism, as well as depression, fatigue, intolerance to cold. Might also be a thing with low-T3. Estradiol will suppress your T4 to T3 conversion, so managing that could help. 

If that's not enough then taking T3 in itself at a low dos might help also.","Interesting, so L-Tyrosine is safer?

The same argument can be used against 5-HTP if I recall correctly. Then of course L-Tryptophan has been connected to EMS which doesn't sound pleasant.",Can you elaborate on this? What about L-Tyrosine?,Are you always measuring trough levels?,"hehe, I'm not down with that. :D 

Totally understand avoiding the workouts but I'm not willing to cut them out entirely. I find that it is somewhat better when I eat plenty of carbs and protein and salt ASAP. 

And I don't always get really emotional after sex but sometimes. 

I'm going to start experimenting with L-Tyrosine and 5-HTP. My mood in general is too irritable, I get confrontational much too easily. 

L-Tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine which will inhibit prolactin. 5-HTP the precursor to serotonin, which will stimulate prolactin (sadly).","hehe, I'm not down with that. :D

I don't know why. One thing E2 does is inhibit conversion from T4 -> T3. You've said your T3 levels are good, but who knows. Perhaps they might still be low on average. How's your digestion/metabolism? Do you get cold more easily than others?","Interesting, I heard something similar before. Why is that, do you otherwise get nauseated}",Thanks this helps. I should see if I can get a rT3 test. Do you take the whole 15 in the morning?,What dose are you taking? And what were your levels?,"All I know is studies show E2 can inhibit conversion from T4 to T3. 

&#x200B;

Is Cytomel the pig one? What's the difference between that and Tiromel?",My T3 is mildly low with rT3 somewhat high. Wondering if this will help with brain fog and mood.,"Is this something that passes?

The odd thing is I felt disturbed sleep for the first days as well but then it got really good.","Btw if you figure out how to feel better/what works I'd deeply appreciate it if you let me know. You're the only person I've ever seen describe the exact same thing, horribly emotional after working out and sex. (I sometimes just wake up like that too though).

Personally I will explore the thyroid connection further before I check out PRL again.",Of interest: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3246784/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3246784/) (related to my other comment),"Ahh man. Working out does the same for me. But sometimes I also get it out of the blue. :)

I've actually been considering the possible role of thyroid hormones lately. Hypothyroidism is linked to mood swings (though I've never measured at ""hypo"" levels).  


But ofc. the pituitary adenoma can also mess with thyroid hormones.",Have you had an MRI for a pituitary adenoma?,Do you know what range you're comfortable with? What's your protocol?,"Has anyone noticed this? Looking for something besides the obvious add AI or reduce TRT dosage. It comes on with a very low dose.

Edit: Often comes on randomly, sometimes after working out or sex.","Do / did any of you have problems with that prior to treatment? 

I feel overly emotional randomly it seems, almost to the point of crying. Don't know if there are triggers, but sometimes after working out, sometimes after sex.. sometimes after nothing at all.","Sucks. Worst of all I haven't been able to measure the prolactin at a high level. Having sex and then going in for a blood test seems impractical (and skews the test). 

What'd your doctor say when you described this symptom? And are there any others that you noticed?"
fcampos2015,"Tenho 23 anos, não sou um cara com uma saúde ruim (apesar de ser bem sedentário nos últimos anos) e não tive nenhum problema recentemente de saúde.

Ando sentindo um desconforto no lado esquerdo do peito, com uma dor estranha no lado esquerdo do pescoço. Eu achava que isso era falta de sono (eu durmo muito mal quando estou trabalhando), mais essas dores começaram até quando eu durmo 8 horas e tals.

Acho que é psicológico, mais se não for, não tenho idéia do que pode ser.","Nunca tive namoradas ou pessoas conhecidas, nunca fui em uma festa, nunca fiquei na rua até muito tarde.

E sempre me senti inferior as outras pessoas, isso foi uma constante em toda a minha vida.

Quando eu era adolescente e até hoje, eu não consigo me ver como uma pessoa, parece que eu sou outra coisa.

Se pelo menos eu tivesse sido triste, mais usado isso ora fazer alguma loucura ou coisa do tipo. Mais eu só ficava postando em rede social e esperando um dia inteiro por uma resposta, por anos a fio.

Isso nunca vai voltar. A minha juventude vai srmpre estar perdida a não ser que exista algo como reeincarnação no pós vida. Eu penso seriamente nisso.

Minha mãe tem boa parte de culpa nisso, ela sempre trabalhou muito, mais também tinha medo irracional que eu ficasse com outras pessoas.

Lembro que ela sempre falava (e até hoje fala) que eu tenho a idade mental de 13 anos, e as vezes até fala que eu deveria ir pro hospicio junto com o meu pai nas brigas. (antes dele morrer 1 ano atrás)

Tenho impressão que ela realmente acha que eu tenho um atraso mental ou autismo ou coisa parecida. Ela nunuca levou nada do que eiñu falo a sério, lembro de näo poder ir pra padaria com uns 14 anos, porque minha mãe tinha medo. (se bem que meu pai na época meio que perseguia minha mãe)

Maior parte da minha infância foi vendo meu irmão mais velho jogar videogame já que ele era mais forte, e sempre minha mãe falava ""resolvam entre vocês"".

Minha infância foi uma mentira, e acho que eu tive ansiedade, porque realmente eu nunca conseguia fazer nada muito complexo que já me achava um fracassado.

As vezes eu chorava porque me considerava bom em nada. Minha mãe sempre tratou tudo com indiferênçaou me criticava por tudo. Eu me lembro de várias vezes ela me expulsando do quarto dela quando eu só queria falar.

Ela também tem/tinha a mania de prometer algo muito loco (viagens ou presentes) só como forma de fazer eu ficar quieto.

Tenho uma mania de fantasiar  de matar ela um dia, e fico pensando constantemente em planos pra isso. Mais no fundo eu sei que só eu posso mudar.

Mais também penso que só vou ter paz quando ela morrer. Isso pode ser fantasia dela também.

Mais até lá ja vou ter uns 30, e a vida não vai valer muito mais, já vou ter perdido as experiências, e vou ser um alejado permanente.

Ela tem um controle irracional sobre mim, ela estudou psicologia, e sei que ela usou táticas dessas comigo, porque ela tem vários livros anotados sobre o assunto.

É como se eu tivesse um medo irracional dela ficar brava, é quse um gatilho de arma ou coisa parecida

Ela me força a ir a igreja todo o domingo com isso, desde os 13 anos. Eu não consigo ficar nervoso ou reagir. Sinto um descobforto em ser bravo e defender opiniões. Meu medo é ser excluido e desagradar as pessoas.

Eu fico me fantasiando de ter muita fama ou fazer algo muito fantastico ou de passar por uma provação muito forte, mais sei que esse momento nunca vai vir.","Now i'm interested in law, justice and the connection between law and history.","Esse é um fenômeno que eu vejo só na esquerda. A ânsia muito grande de passar uma neutralidade, desde a arte e o design neutro que eles próprios criam no discurso ou na parte gráfica (sempre citando autores, analisando fenômenos, vendo a sociedade de cima)

Até em um uso das metáforas e comparações, tentando passar uma linguagem poética, que passa uma imagem jornalistica, mais é na verdade só uma opinião política.","I always wondered what popular songs could replace John Adams classical music in modern era.

I always thought of Jimi Hendrix ""All Along The Watchtower"" and Bob Dylan ""Like A Rolling Stone"" and something of jazz and trip hop playing.","Why is it so important (or not)?

It can be technical books or fiction.","I'm not an old person, but suddenly I started to think about getting old, decay, memories, having memories about old times, since I've started to work in a job that involves dealing just with elders.","Não precisa ser um stress muito grande.

Comigo acontece quando eu tenho que fazer algo extremamente complicado, com expectativa de algumas pessoas.

Mesmo depois que a situação acaba, ainda fico com essa sensação o resto do dia, e as vezes, dura alguns dias.","Muita gente é a favor da punição do Gentili, com a idéia de que não existem direitos absolutos.

 Racismo e outros crimes que envolvem a fala de alguém são punidos, porque a fala do Gentili não poderia ser punida nesse caso?

Nessa idéia a liberdade de expressão seria relativa e nem todo tipo de fala poderia se incluir nela.

O que vocês acham?","Serio, vejo esse tipo de argumentação toda hora, tanto aqui no reddit quanto em outros lugares.

O engraçado é que na maioria das vezes o alvo do argumento já passou por y (em maior ou menor grau), mais mesmo assim o argumento acaba colando.

Ou supor que pessoas que nunca passaram por uma situação não podem opinar sobre ela, nem entender o sentimento e as emoções da pessoa que passou por aquilo.

É um argumento bem estranho, porque apesar de não se aplicar a maioria das pessoas, ainda parece meio que uma forma de sinalizar virtude e desqualificar o oponente antes de ouvir a opinião dele.","Eu trabalho em um lugar que recebe diariamente algumas centenas de pessoas, e meio que consigo ver na pratica como a imigração funcionou no Brasil.

Essa suposição veio na minha cabeça. Se o Brasil não tivesse a onda de imigração no sec. 19 e 20 e recebidos japoneses, alemães, italianos, arabes e etc, que efeitos isso teria no Brasil de hoje?","Vou fazer 24 anos, mais nunca tive uma infância bacana e nem uma juventude bacana.

Nunca fiz nada, passei anos da minha vida obcecado por coisas que eu queria ou fantasias da minha cabeça.

 Tipo, ficar 8 horas vendo vídeos de um jogo que eu nunca consegui comprar, ou ficar fantasiando namoradas que eu nunca consegui achar.

Hoje eu me sinto preso. Não posso ser adulto porque nunca tive as experiências de um, e não posso ter essas experiências porque não sou adulto","Até em assuntos que eu tenha um certo conhecimento, eu me expresso mal ou acabo deixando as pessoas confusas.

Isso acontece tanto quando eu falo sobre alguma coisa, ou quando tento escrever um texto.

As vezes eu consigo visualizar o que eu vou falar, os argumentos, como ligar um assunto ao outro, mais quando eu vou falar ou escrever sobre algo, parece que tudo sai meio embaralhado.

Na maioria das vezes esse problema acontece em alguma discussão sobre um assunto mais complicado, só que as vezes eu me confundo até pra falar sobre o trabalho ou pra explicar alguma coisa que aconteceu uma semana atrás.

Não sei se é falta de prática em escrever ou falar sobre assuntos mais complexos, ansiedade, ou porque eu não tenho conhecimento sobre esses assuntos na verdade.","Tem aquela pesquisa que fala que cada vez mais jovens deixam de fazer sexo, ou perdem a virgindade mais tarde.

","Alguém pode esclarecer se essa aproximação do Bolsonaro com Israel é boa ou ruim? Seja na diplomacia, geopolítica ou no comércio mesmo.

Até agora só vi gente de um lado falando sobre atentados terroristas e outros de tecnologia, mais nada concreto.

","Vocês já frequentaram alguma?

Tem muita gente nesses lugares? ","Só um pensamento de chuveiro...

Talvez uns 100 anos atrás, quando a comunicação era difícil e ainda existiam lugares isolados, as capitais eram necessárias.

Hoje, com tudo conectado, porque elas são necessárias? Talvez descentralizar o governo economizaria mais grana.","Sei que aqui é um lugar certo pra perguntar essas coisas.

Algum livro pode ajudar a melhorar a ansiedade ou desespero?","As pessoas tentam buscar os lugares que essas pessoas frequentavam, ideologia, vida amorosa, política, religião.

Daí falam de todos os problemas que essas pessoas tem, isolamento, raiva, depressão, bullying e etc.

Mais ignoram totalmente as pessoas dentro desses grupos e a história pessoal delas e a opinião delas, independente de apoiar masacres ou não.

Me parece que essa tentativa de compreender separa e exclui ainda mais esses grupos.","Não sou um grande fã de rap nacional, mais gosto de acompanhar as músicas que estão em alta e tals.

Parece que 90% das músicas segue a mesma fórmula onde o cara fala sobre as mesmas coisas, só que com rimas diferentes e uma batida meio minimalista:

""sou negro e todo mundo acha que eu sou ladrão""

""podia ter morrido no lugar onde eu nasci""

""eles pensaram que eu não ia conseguir""

""todo mundo queria que eu fosse ladrão""

""negros morrem toda a hora no Brasil""

""racismo existe e vocês colaboram com isso""

""alguma analogia com negros, africa ou rap com alguma outra coisa""


bonus: música obrigatória sobre paixão sofrida com referências a drogas e sexo selvagem, com o cara falando que sabe tudo de sexo ao contrário do virgem reprimido que xinga ele nas redes sociais.



","Eu trabalho em um lugar onde atendo muita gente e confiro muitas assinaturas. Daí eu pensei, porque raios eu não tenho a minha própria assinatura/rubrica (eu assino como eu escrevo meu nome mesmo)

Só que eu não faço ideia de como criar uma. ","De cabeça lembro daquele Cansei de Ser Sexy, o Angra e o Sepultura.

Tem também umas pessoas que fizeram sucesso no pasado tipo o Jobim e aquele Sérgio Mendes (?)","Desculpem meu total desconhecimento.

Compus algumas musicas no violão e queria gravar elas de uma forma decente. Qual o equipamento mínimo que eu preciso ter?","Por exemplo, uma pessoa que seja de uma posição política contraria como imoral ou não confiavel, ou uma pessoa de religião diferente como ruim?

Óbvio que existem posições que todos vão julgar. Se o cara é nazista, maioria das pessoas vão desprezar ele.

Mas outras posições como esquerdistas ou o pessoal que defende a ditadura ou evangélicos fanáticos?","É uma pequena dúvida que eu tenho.

Óbvio que o hedonismo e o sexo sem limites e a fama devem cansar as pessoas assim como a falsidade desses meios.

Mais porque essas pessoas do nada escolhem entrar em outra religião e falar isso pra todo mundo. 

Em vez de só mudar o modo de vida delas? 

Ou entrar pra outra religião?","Vejo muita gente de esquerda recentemente usando os menes da ""família brasileira"", ""reaça pobre"" ou ""liberal pobre"" pra tentar ridicularizar a direita.

E a direita sempre usou a parada de ""esquerdista de Iphone"", ""feminista mal-comida"" e etc pra zoar a esquerda.

Esses xingamentos servem pra alguma coisa além de zueira de grupinho ou vocês acham que menes realmente servem pra alguma coisa na política?

Vale mais criar esteriótipos ou debater e derrotar o adversário, no ponto de vista político?","""A arte da economia está em considerar não só os efeitos imediatos de qualquer ato ou política, mas, também, os mais remotos; está em descobrir as consequências dessa política, não somente para um único grupo, mas para todos eles. Nove décimos das falácias sobre economia, que estão causando um terrível mal ao mundo, resultam da ignorância dessa lição. Originam-se todas elas de uma das duas falácias fundamentais, ou de ambas: considerar somente as consequências imediatas de um ato, ou proposta, e apenas as suas consequências, para um determinado grupo, esquecendo os demais.“

Não sou nenhum especialista em economia, e honestamente, não sei se essa reforma é boa ou ruim, só que 90% das pessoas que eu vejo discutindo o assunto, só fazem isso olhando o ponto de vista imediato de que tal emprego vai ser desfavorecido ou tal empresa vai se fortalecer."

Currently 21, graduated with a bachelor degree and now studying a master's degree for another year to escape from reality that I will be stepped on like a doormat once when I get out there. 

All these years, I've done nothing but afraid and running away. I've improved at basically nothing. I'm the same, if not worse, then the person I was a few years before. 

I have no strengths, talents. No passions. No dreams or goals to work towards to. I process information slowly, and I feel like an idiot at all times. I know nothing about life, society and my social skills is so god awful that I feel like I cannot fit in anywhere. I'm a pathetic coward who got so scared at basically anything. I've tried going out there, opening up just to get laughed at, hated, used, despised. And if people were to be friend with me, they just do it out of sympathy. So I retracted away from everyone. 

I have no friends, no relationships, no one to release my frustrations and sadness. My family is the only thing that keeps me going, but I just feel like I can't talk to them. Though I am not sure how long I can try, I am partly reliefed because I am not even brave enough to end my own life, and I am lucky enough to have a family that love me so much as well, sometimes I feel like I don't deserve any of this love.

I don't know the person that I want to become. But I do know that I don't want to be like this anymore. I don't want to take my own life but I want to take back control. I need to get out of this and just be happy again.",#T A D A N O,"I see your point. But I personally think that memes about depression won't change the facts that depression is actually a horrible thing.

I used the Aerospray for a while and it is so OP in this mode it feels like I'm cheating the game!,"Okay, guess I should consider farming gold instead. Thanks for the advice :)","Yeah but, I have checked and Toni Kensa's gears has the lowest chance for sub power up only, not swim speed up. Which had me confused. To be clear, I checked the brand abilities to make sure they don't have low chance for my ability.

I also thought about getting 60 chunks with the tickets, but I got everything but the ability from the drinks. Which is why I said that either my luck is god awful, or there is just something wrong that I don't quite understand yet.","I see. But I have read a gear making guide somewhere which states that I can wait to get my desired ability to be in at least one of the first two slots, and only scrub if the third one isn't the one that I want. Is this cheaper than the other method?

Also, my luck really IS bad. I've been levelling up countless times and only ONE time it rolls my drink ability. WTF?","I am going for the ink saver main (and right now, still a priority), but my luck in salmon run bonuses is so damn awful, that I got the drinks for ALL abilities but the ink saver main. So, I decided to work on other pure gear for the time being, hence I am going with swim speed up.

So far, I only buy gears selectively if they look good/ have an ability that I like. So, If i see a gear that either looks lame (plain T-shirts), or have an ability that I don't like (Quick respawn, quick super jump, spawn punisher, etc..) then I won't buy it. Instead, I save my money only for scrubbing, gears that I like and weapons. But I get what you mean.","Hey everyone, I'm still a little new to the game so if there is anything I said wrong, feel free to correct me ^^

Anyways, I've been trying to get a pure gear ( Main abilities is the same as all sub abilities). I've also done some research with brands and their common abilities. So as far as I know, the brand of the gear that you want will x5 times as likely to roll their common brand ability than any other abilities, so if you want to wear that wear with the ability that YOU want (say, Toni Kensa coat with Swim Speed Up), you need a drink of that ability to increase the chance.

However, I keep scrubbing and leveling up but no matter how hard I try, my Kensa coat keeps getting Main Power Up (The brand's main ability), up to three slots in a row all in 1 go. I am now down to 100K gold.


Is the ticket broken? Why does it not increase the chance to get my ability? Yes, it is true that the brand favours that ability, but would that make the drink tickets useless? Because even with that drink, no matter which brand I choose, the gear will always roll their common ability instead of the one of the drink ticket? 

This is all very confusing, and it cost me 100k already. I want to know if I should even bother with the drinks.

TL;DR: I had a drink of an ability but the gear that I want to wear keeps rolling the brand's common ability rather than the drink's ability.",W,[Loud Woomy](https://youtu.be/mUYj-WyJ420),I'm sorry but your laughter is golden.

Today, I dreamed of being the woman I thought I am and never was. 

It was winter and gloomy. I didn't know exactly what was going on but there's one thing I know for sure. I was living by myself in some house apartment I think. Until that winter day, that man came. We became friends and have been seeing like we've known each other since. Then at one moment everything seemed to be different. I really don't understand what was happening. There were signs and clues that tells me that there was definitely something wrong. The people around me has also been suspicious. And I asked him why. I asked him the answer to my questions I longed to know. Everbody seemed to know the truth and I didn't. And it felt like I didn't belong. I was screaming inside. Desperately wanting to know the hidden truth. There was a blizzard in the house from outside and I was stuck. I couldn't get out because the door was blocked with some weird sticky thing that has big holes in it. I don't know how to describe it. And as much as I wanted to get out, I just seem to really trust that man behind the door. That same man. I was shouting, wanting to escape that misery. Until, I woke up. No, it's not what you think. It was a dream within a dream. But at that moment, it was reality. My reality. I opened my eyes and see myself in a house. It was a bright day with the warm rays of sunlight throughout the room. I was in bed asleep all this time. It was a beautiful season of summer. There was someone with me. A teenager, a preschooler, and a baby. They were all boys and they were all mine. My children. I got out of bed to go outside. The season then turned to fall. It's not sunshiny as it was after I got out. We live in a cabin somewhere in the middle of a forest. Someone arrived. I was definitely sure who he was. He was wearing a jacket and he was tall. And I trust him. And love him deeply. For he is the one I seek. A ""Man of God"".

""My mind is full of thoughts, yet it feels so empty.""

It was midnight, and I woke up from a nightmare. It felt really horrible. I was scared. Scared of losing control. I didn't remember what my dream exactly was about. It was like a rush of adrenaline, fragments runnning wild through my mind. My upper body was flaccid. I wanted to get back to sleep but I just couldn't. It was like someone pulling me, grabbing my back. More like my soul. My heart felt rested but not calm. That flash of series of events in my dream was terrible. I got out of bed, drank water and ate a pie. I then took my blood pressure, 90/50 mmHg, 90/40. I drank a mug of warm tea and Mom massaged my back for a little while. Got back to bed but my eyes and mind just wouldn't shut. That same feeling won't disappear. Getting back to sleep was hard, so I grab a book. The title reads - ""Terror On Tuesday"". But it's Monday, I say.

I love you.",Amazing I hope your date goes well. You are an inspiration! You are a wonderful person ❤,"I get it. There's garbage in your neighborhood, your stuff might be getting stolen. It's shitty. Maybe your anger and frustrations should be directed on the lack of low income housing available to them. Maybe it should be directed at the shitty system implemented to ""help"" and ""support"" those who are sick, perhaps fighting addiction or they are just really down on their luck. How about our government stops wasting money on making our cities look pretty when the people on the streets living like this show the true ugliness of the world we live in. Maybe our focus should be that or even the people on the brink of homelessness.

They're all people. They've all tried and the way things are is just not working. The system is not great, so why are we not doing anything? Maybe we need to stand together and fight for change. Not just for those we don't know but for the future generations who will eventually face these struggles as well, because as hard as it is to accept, it's not always preventable. 

Maybe you need to recognize how privileged you are to be on the side that complains about people who don't have a home, feel happy you don't have to carry all of your belongings in a shopping cart, or sleep on the cold street, or even in a room filled with a few dozen other people you don't know and can't trust. That you get to shower every day and have a comfy place to call home.

Help. In anyway you can. Give support to your community so these things don't have to happen anymore. So these people and future people don't have to suffer. Ask for change from our government and supports. These are human beings, they deserve to be comfortable, they deserve roofs over their head and food in their bellies. 

Change for the better is possible, and clearly complaining isn't doing anything. Except making you look entitled over a bunch of people who's lives are not where they want to be. Believe it or not, they don't want this, and maybe they've been taught accepting help is bad because of societies skewed views over social assistance and how negative it is considered to take the help that's designed for these situations, and stop patronizing these people because they can't figure out how to get it to where they want to be, it probably feels impossible. Our mental health system is crap, our low income system is garbage, and these people are just as much a part of our communities as you and I are.

It was fun, he was happy and we actually had a really great day. One of the best I remember to be honest. I've trip sat him a few times since and it has been good.

However, if you're not comfortable then I would perhaps end things and let him do as he pleases. The begging will not stop and to be honest he has the right to explore curiosity. You cannot expect him to sit and accept your beliefs as his own. If you do however feel as if you'd be open then maybe just trip sit him and be around him and see for yourself.

I could be wrong, but I am fairly confident in this.","I fundamentally disagree with any bumper stickers whatsoever, let alone political ones.","Can you give me sources to back up your claim that more Republican officials have been target by attacks? I don’t disbelieve you, but I am not aware of any recent attempts to harm the President or anyone on his staff, let alone assassination attempts. The most chilling examples of political violence that I have heard about recently was Cesar Sayoc, and I believe 1-2 mass shooters openly admitting that Trump’s ideologies spurred them on. 

I am not saying that I believe Trump even hinted for his supporters to commit these heinous acts, but I also don’t remember hearing him admonishing any attacks in his name. Granted, I don’t remember hearing any Democrats say anything about violence in their names, but as the President of the United States, I believe a hard line must be drawn when a very outspoken minority of your supporters are committing these hateful acts.","Comparing keeping people healthy to giving away cars and leisure aren’t the same. We could, think of this, cut back a bit on military spending. We have a very powerful military already, why continue raising how much we spend on it? That could probably offset the cost of allowing people to seek aid.

I never claimed Conservatives are heartless, but implying that Liberals are mindless isn’t helping. There are ways to balance spending, I don’t think America has really ever been good at that, going back to its inception.","I know that’s a commonplace joke, but it more alarms me the frequency at which I see that joke being made at many Liberal/Democrat government officials. I of course have seen similar jokes being made about Pence or Trump, but rarely does it go beyond the two of them. And I find making jokes referencing killing anyone questionable, aside from some obvious bad guys like, yknow, Hitler or Bin Laden. Those guys deserve any joke about them that anyone can make. They suck.","Let me begin by saying I come from a military family, so I have nothing but the utmost respect for soldiers from any branch. Thank you for your service, because I know I wouldn’t have the bravery to go and fight in any war. You’re certainly braver than I am. However, I do believe that the Vietnam War in itself was not necessary, and that the political elite that propagated it were fueled by greed and “anti-Red” ideology more than a genuine fear of America being harmed. So while I respect you for fighting in it, I do not respect the war itself.

I can understand being upset at the mistreatment of veterans, and it genuinely makes me furious that America practically neglects veterans when they leave the military. I know most soldiers in Vietnam were treated VERY harshly on return. It sickens me the way people who laid their lives down for this country were abandoned on return.

In reference to being scrutinized by media, you must surely see that Right Wing media outlets do the same, though. I fail to see how many people in media having Liberal views equates to personal attacks on the Left.

As for your “indoctrination” claim, I frankly see that as untrue. I am currently in college and only now am I seeing any major political ideology in my schooling. Growing up, the most political pressure that I felt was frankly that of Nationalism, not the influence of one side or the other. Just America. Reciting the Pledge or Allegiance every day, having posters of every president in almost every classroom, etc. I grew up and still live in a fairly split town, which could also contribute to the fact that I didn’t feel sway to either side. For most of the time where I was capable of keeping up with politics (which has only been about 6 years, to be fair) I would have said that I was Conservative or Independent. It is only within the past year or so where I have realized that I am a Liberal. I’m not sure how much interaction you have with the current education system, and the schools in the area you live may conduct differently than the schools I attended.","I commend anyone who came to America legally, and also any who came here in search of a new and free life. Those who came here legally have certainly been through more than many people, and I understand the unfair nature of the idea of any who came here illegally gaining the same perks as them. I don’t have any solutions on how to reach a happy median, hence why I am not involved in politics on a career level. But I don’t think that we should put every single person who comes to America under one single umbrella and label them all as equally reprehensible as “criminals”. Yes they broke the law by illegally entering, but that doesn’t make them evil or bad, does it? And I understand that it is “easy” to come to America through the cartels, but then you have to deal with the imminent danger that comes with, well, associating with cartels.","I believe that the border wall in and of itself isn’t a TERRIBLE idea, but the way that Trump has “marketed” it for lack of a better word, was not great. As with many things, he focused too much on promoting a “strong man” image instead of strictly focusing on the ways this could benefit the U.S. Also, he sought to make it look OFFENSIVE and not DEFENSIVE, which is another mark against it in my book. 

Please let me know if this is already in practice, but I have not heard of such a thing so as of now, this seems to be just a fantasy of mine. I believe that any person who came across the border illegally should be punished, but I disagree with deportation as that creates a whole new set of problems. If a person safely makes it to the U.S. in order to find a better life for themselves or their family, I believe they should be able to appeal for citizenship. But I believe that opportunities should be available for undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. to apply for citizenship while remaining in the U.S., as not to tear their lives from them. And contrary to popular belief, it’s not as easy to enter legally as many think. It’s not just “wait in line at the border”, it can take months or even years. I cannot think of specifics at the moment, but I remember hearing a story of a man from India who has family (including a son) in the U.S. The family is here legally, and waiting for the father. However his youngest child, who I believe was 14 years old, stated that because of the current laws in place, his father may not ever be able to immigrate legally because by the time he is cleared, he most likely will have been dead for decades. I may not have told the story clearly so let me know if I can clarify.

Finally, I believe that healthcare is a human right, not an American one. Again, I believe that it is way too difficult to legally come to America.

I will fall back on my default opinion. I don’t see the process of undertaking a life-threatening journey to the U.S. today as any different than the Pilgrims coming to America on the Mayflower. I believe that only certified violent criminals should be deported from the United States.

Please let me know if you have any questions or want me to clarify anything I’ve said!","Are you asking me, or telling me what to say in conversation?","Alright, the next opportunity that I have where I can naturally bring up a right wing view without forcing politics or social conversation upon anyone, I will, and I’ll report back.","I’m also a happy person who loves what my country could be (if people just chill out and work together), family, and freedom. 

And I have before, and they’re always pretty chill about it. We can disagree and then carry on a conversation. I’ve brought up with my one friend before the problem that transgender female athletes competing against biological females poses, and offered the solution of making a new category of transgender athletes, therefore allowing them to compete while keeping the playing field level for biological women. My friend disagreed, stated that if someone identifies as a woman they should be treated as such, and then we carried on. It wasn’t a “sudden transformation”, it was a normal conversation.","Lol I didn’t even notice I was getting downvoted.

Either do it, show my why it would medically be dangerous, or refer me to a doctor whose moral biases are not a few centuries behind the times","That’s all what I’ve been told too. Hysterectomy can also include different specifics. My friends mom yelled at me when I said I wanted one because when they removed her cervix the removed her ability to orgasm. I explicitly asked my surgeon about this and she was like No. it has nothing to do with it.

So my menopause shouldn’t start till it normally would have (maybe 1 or 2 years early, but in exchange for 20 years of no periods and risk or pregnancy? Hell yeah!)

My anxiety was bad about my periods, that’s why just getting my tubes tied wouldn’t have done much for my life.

No way for me.

The second one looked me straight in the eye and said she felt it was immoral because I was so young (at 27, in a PhD program for the next 5 years, married, etc). I had to search for a surgeon in my network myself and had two visits with her before she agreed (strongly reluctant the whole time). But once the scheduling ball got rolling, it kept on going until I got it my uterus, tubes, and cervix removed. I was scared the whole time of it being stopped even when sitting in the pre-op area wearing the gown. But I finally got it and am happier and more at peace than ever, to the point where I honestly don’t really understand why all the academic research doesn’t include hysterectomy in childfree research.

Though the pandemic isn’t really helping the dating scene. My thought is, if you know you won’t ever want kids when your single, what difference does a partner make. My sterility might make an impact on my relationships, but my relationships will not be affecting my sterility choices. After all, if I want to be childfree and a potential partner wants children, particularly biological ones, then clearly they aren’t the partner for me.

Thank you so much!,"I don’t know if you answered OP’s question, but you surprisingly gave me the name of a book that I read in middle school at church camp and could never remember the name of, so know that you’ve helped at least in person.😁",I think I’ve read this! Was the main character really into dissecting dead animals and got together with a young woman at the end?,"I read this book series probably about ten years ago when I was still a young teenager.

I think I read two books in the series, please excuse me if I get some details about each book mixed together. 

The first is about a woman who survives a fire that killed her sister, but she ends up extremely scarred on her back and shoulders. She’s extremely sensitive about it and always wears a glove on one hand. One day she’s out in the forest and sees a beautiful man swimming naked. At some point she’s cured from her scars, but gives it up to help save her lover. I think she’s also very tall and is very happy to find a man that is so much taller than her (honestly my favorite trope).

The second book is about a woman whose sister died soon after childbirth. She comes to the area where the highlanders live and work because she is looking for the father of her baby nephew per her sister’s last wishes. At some point she is stuck in a cave trying to keep from freezing to death and is convinced it’s the spirit of her sister’s ashes(kept in an Oreo cookie jar) that kept her alive. The male lead assumes the baby is hers for most of the series and when he finds out who the father is(someone who was their enemy when they were in the past) he tries to convince her to just be with him and he’ll raise the baby as his own. The woman is a virgin when they meet and has six older brothers (making her a seventh daughter). She gets visited by a wizard at some point who says that she will have seven daughters and that her youngest child will become his apprentice.

Some other things I remember: the highlanders own a ski lift and that the patriarch of the clan became an actual wolf for some reason? 

The books I read were out of order, so sorry if that’s just a mess.",YTA. I am an adopted child and my parents are my real parents. Maybe think about someone besides yourself for a change.

Did anyone else read the fanfiction “Mystic Eyes” by claymaker on ff.net?

 [Link Here](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5842747/1/Mystic-Eyes)

This story came out when I was in middle school, and I was obsessed with the author. They haven’t written anything on that account since 2011, but I was always super interested in what happened to them and if they were still making content somewhere else.

Yashahime coming out rekindled my love for Inuyasha and this story, if anyone else has read this story, or knows what happened to the author, feel free to comment or DM me☺️"," [Link Here](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5842747/1/Mystic-Eyes)

Honestly, this whole thing has made me feel like I was a teenager again, and I’m so happy when people share their experiences about watching Inuyasha the first time🥰",Haha! I also read it in middle school! It’s been rattling around in my head bothering me for a few years now. I’m so excited to finally know what it was called!,Yes! That is exactly it! Thanks so much!!!!,"I’m looking for a book about a girl whose family only has daughter and her uncle’s family only has sons and is wealthier.

She leaves her family to dress as a man and become a merchant. At one point all of her male cousins ask her to lend them money (not knowing it’s her), and she agrees to just give them the money as long as they get a tattoo.

When she finally comes back to her family, they try and force her to marry one of her male cousins, but she says she could never marry a man with a tattoo, and all but one of them does (the nice one never borrowed money) and so she marries him.","Makes sense. I do also get the feeling that Morhoha knows a lot more than we’re being told, but also I feel like if I had no idea where I came from or who my parents were, I’d at least be a little bit curious, especially if I was right in front of someone who seemed to have all of the answers?",I just assumed she wanted the job for the bounty reward. Plus she seems a lot more fighting = fun than the other girls.,"SPOILERS FOR EPISODE FOUR!

When the girls are talking to Treekyo, they find out that Setsuna and Towa’s father is Sesshomaru and Mohora knows that her mom is Kagome (unsure if she knows about Inuyasha, he’s never mentioned), but they just don’t ask any questions? They don’t even seem curious about what happened to Sesshomaru or who their mother is. It just seems weird to me?

Do you guys think this is a result of the writing to make the mystery last longer, or is this a foreshadowing to why the girls don’t remember/know their parents.",Anyone else leave that episode ready to fight😂 I need to know what’s going on now! Also I’m so happy that my girls are starting to get along!

I’m 15 and feel like I could have it, but my parents refuse to get me tested for anything.","I’ve been smoking for a few months and I really enjoy weed, but I was talking with a friend the other day and started to realize that my highs may not be normal.

When I smoke, I usually feel very relaxed and music is really nice. However, I get this weird thing where I feel like I’m in a movie and nothing is really real. It doesn’t freak me out or anything. I really like feeling disconnected. 

Like I can look down at my hands and feel completely amazed that I have a body. Walking also feels really light like I’m floating a bit. I can look in the mirror and I don’t see myself. I feel like I’m outside of my body observing a different person. 

Recently, I’ve started feeling like this without weed though and it’s really scaring me. It isn’t pleasant at all. This has been happening basically every night for a couple weeks now. I can’t look in the mirror sometimes because I kind of forget what I look like and start questioning my existence.

Does weed feel like this for you guys too or is there something wrong with me?

Currently 5’4 and 117 Ibs

Around 3 months ago, I weighed in at 138 and finally decided I wanted to get in shape. This was mainly because of how big my stomach was getting. 

Since then, I’ve cut out certain foods completely (like soda) and have replaced those things with fruit and veggies. I don’t consume as many carbs or sugar anymore and I jog on a treadmill 3 days a week.

I’ve lost 20 pounds, but there has been no change in my stomach region. I’ve already gone down 3 cup sizes. :( I was told to lower my bf percentage, I had to eat less calories than I took in and that I couldn’t target stomach fat. 

I just feel like 117 is low for my height? Would I have to lose more weight to get a flat stomach? My mom is already accusing me of being anorexic and limited my jogs to 3 days a week. (At first it was everyday, then every other day, now only 3 days per week). 

Idk what to do. She randomly checks my weight and if I lose too much, she will stop me from exercising completely. Is it possible I only lost muscle? I don’t really work out, just cardio. 

I just really need advice. Does anyone know why my stomach hasn’t changed in size at all? 

If it helps I also noticed that although I have lost weight, I’ve gotten more.. jiggly."
whiteboxofhoodies,"I'm 23 years old and life is overall just depressing. Its time like right now when I'm alone thinking about how lonely I am and how time has elapsed and how much things have changed that really upset me. I have friends that  I really love and that really love me and I talk to everyday, but I can't help but feel so lonely most of the time. I lost my best friend to suicide just over a year ago and that tears me to this day. I feel guilty because I talked to him everyday since the day we met. It didn't matter if we were sick or busy at work, we found time to talk and play games every single day. In 2019 he opened up to me about his depression and I really tried to help him the best I could through it. I brought him into every project I was working on ( I used to do a lot of motion graphics and photo/videography). Yet in the end he took his own life. I feel guilty because I could have told his mom or someone close to him but I was scared to break any trust he had with me. I didn't want for him to feel he couldn't trust me and would be completely alone. I never thought he would do what he did and if i felt he was going to I would have told. But looking back, I am upset with myself for thinking I would be able to help.   


2019 was hard for me to begin with. It started with my first heart break which completely destroyed me, then my uncle was beaten to death in an alley. A few months later another family member shot himself in his house. Then my friends death and then the very next day my grandmas husband died. A month after one of my ex friends was in a discord call with me high on about 22 bars of xanax and started to OD on camera. I called 911 and his life was saved but he turned his back on me and we are no longer friends. 

I spent a lot of time during all of these events being very hateful. I was mad at the world and everyone because I didn't know how to feel or what to think. Every emotion I had was bottled up and turned into hate. I reflect on the person I was and it just makes me even more depressed. I wasted so much time  being a piece of shit. I was mad at people who did absolutely nothing to me. I had a friend I would ask for help and advice when I needed it and he would always give me quality advice on any situation since he had been though a lot. This past year I started to focus on my art more so  I can try and get my career started after this pandemic. I deleted all my socials and only talked to my two close friends I have left. I recently went back to check up on him and seen hes removed everything hes done over the past 5 years and is inactive on social media. It makes me sad because he was always there for me when I needed it and i never took his advice and all he ever had was my best intentions. He really cared about me and I completely ignored everything he said. And now it seems hes having struggles and I abandoned him and the community he built. I dont know how hes doing and have no way to reach out to him. If you ever read this you know who you are and i really appreciate everything youve ever done for me and im sorry that all I ever did was ignore you and wasnt there for you when you were having your life issues. I love you bro.

&#x200B;

Even now its too the point where seeing people happy makes me depressed. On Halloween I was watching a twitch streamer I sometimes hang out with and just seeing his positive attitude with his friends made me sad. I dont know why. I dont know why seeing someone playing their favorite game with their favorite people and having a good time makes me sad. Maybe im just an overly emotional person. I dont know I feel the way I do overall. Ive never been diagnosed with anything since ive never gone to anyone for help. I think of wasted time and the people I love and happy strangers and it all makes me depressed. Im not suicidal, I don't want to die. I understand and appreciate the miracle of life and I know that once I'm gone that everything is over. A void. And I know things can be better. Sometimes I think im fine and everything is okay and im happy, but when I'm by myself, I realize how lonely and depressed I really am. My anxiety the past year has intensified. At this point if anyone outside of about 3 people message me I have an anxiety attack. I have random panic attacks that feel like im going to die. I overthink every interaction I have with anyone new. Sometimes I just want one person I can lean on and cry to about everything in my head. I don't know when or if  they will ever show up but that is what keeps me going a lot of the time.   


Im sorry to all the people I've let down in the past. I'm sorry to everyone I've upset in my hateful mindset. Im sorry to anyone who believed in me  and yet I've failed. And to all the people who have sat by my side though out any hardship, I love you.",Not much has happened but there was a girl I thought was really pretty in one of my classes.

Was this you?

Edit: Oh wait just saw the “source” thing in another comment, my bad","I dunno, man. The “left her hanging” comment (joking about a suicide that you personally induced... that’s one hell of a low) really casts some doubts in my mind that Monika could possibly regret her actions until at least Act III. And after Sayori’s death but before Act II, where MC is having a mental breakdown and monologuing, she specifically chooses the scene where he says (not word for word but pretty much) “this isn’t a game, I can’t go back and make different decisions, I could’ve saved her, I killed my best friend” to go ahead and delete previous saves. This has the effect of making a regretful player go back and try to save her... *only to find out they’re no longer allowed, while also being told by MC that they could have saved her.* Monika intentionally did that... that’s a horrible, sick joke at the player’s expense. I think that stuff like this... it just goes to show that, until she’s brought to a FULL stop in Act III, she’s unwilling (and possibly unable) to reform. It’s almost like she gets off on it.

When facing run-of-the-mill depression and “mundane” mental problems in his best friend, MC is poorly equipped but well-intentioned. With some effort, MC might manage to start handling mental health situations effectively. But when he’s up against the all-consuming, vengeful, (for much of the game) unrepentantly horrible, godlike creature that is Monika... he doesn’t have a chance.","Yeah, Monika didn’t explicitly want Sayori *dead*, but she didn’t seem to mind if that happened anyway so long as Sayori was out of the picture. I feel like Monika wouldn’t have gone back at this point even if she realised what she was doing; you saw the mindwipe she pulled on Natsuki when she got concerned about Yuri. Monika actively intervened there to stop the MC or Natsuki from counteracting the damage Monika was inflicting on Yuri’s mind. If Monika’s willing to be *that* cold, then Sayori in a hospital bed (with the MC completely focused on her, no less) wouldn’t make Monika see the light.","To an observer, doesn’t she appear to be spiralling though? She’s noticeably off, and then excuses herself early. She then *admits* her depression, which would suggest that it’s getting so hard she doesn’t trust herself to handle it on her own anymore. She completely broke down afterwards... and then after encountering Monika or Yuri, she’s very visibly hurting. To be fair, MC’s not exactly equipped to handle this, but it isn’t like the signs weren’t there. There were enough signs that, come Monday morning and Sayori not answering her texts, the player can infer what happened. However, the MC still has to look at the “poem” to realise all the signs at once. To his credit, once that realisation finally *does* come to him, he makes for Sayori’s house at full speed, but... well, by then it’s too late.

(also good presumably-morning)",I cannot for the life of me read any text box but Monika’s.,https://m.youtube.com/watch?index=362&list=FL769x_MryXKy-MfGJHvRRSw&v=45qlATQNFyE,"The Baked Crusader, pleasure to meet you! We are the Knights Who Say... Ni!","Masks

Yes","Well, to be fair. If you delete Sayori at the start, you’re greeted with that hanging sprite of her; this is BEFORE Monika started messing with things, so that means the sprite of her hanging must’ve been in there somewhere for some reason (even if it only was supposed to occur in a bad dream or something). And in Act I, if you invite Yuri over, there’s a scene where she acts *very* self-conscious, awkward, and paranoid about MC interacting in any way whatsoever with her wrist/forearm. Maybe the pre-epiphany game was pretty dark already, just not horror?","Except, you know, admitting a very short while ago that she’d been depressed all her life. And that her behaviour in the club was being perceptibly affected. And that she was literally in the throes of bigsad emotion when MC left, with visible tears streaming down her face.

NOPE, NOTHIN’ TO WORRY ABOUT HERE","Well, it’s not like “I want to die” is a normal state of mind. That’s crisis territory, and just like any other crisis, **of course** 12 hours can damn well make a massive difference. If he’d been just a bit more attentive, well... actually, no matter what he did, Monika would still see to Sayori’s demise. But if Monika stopped increasing her depression right around when Sayori confessed, the MC still could’ve had a chance if he’d only identified the signs of an obvious mental health crisis in a depressed human. To be fair to him, he couldn’t have known how to respond due to his general isolation, but he wasn’t powerless right then either.",The next morning is why.

Aino23,"I was diagnosed with clinical depression five years ago. I had just left my job, and had been out of work for a few months when I decided to go see a doctor about my health. I had gained a lot of weight and was around 370 pounds at this time, my mental state was getting worse by the day. A lot of the days, I would just stare at the wall doing nothing for 4 hours at a time. I filled out the depression/anxiety questionnaire and was put on Zoloft.

On Zoloft, it did make me feel better, or at least at the time I thought it did. Instead of staring at the wall for 4 hours a day, I was able to instead watch a tv show or play a video game for 4 hours and not feel depressed. An improvement right? Well at the time I thought so too.

Things went on like this for awhile, I felt like I could be content on this medication, but at the same time I still had no ambition to want to better my life. My weight was slowly going up, and my mental state was also getting slightly worse. My doctor upped my dosage which helped.

My mother passed away two years ago which was a really difficult time for me. She was my best friend and I would talk to her every single day about everything. Without her, I felt pretty lost with my life and didn't really know what to do. It had been two years since I found a job, and I still had no ambition or drive to want to better my life, just content with where I was at.

Shortly after my mom passed away, my grandpa was diagnosed with Dementia. Because I had no job and he was already living with us, I decided to be his caretaker. My depression stayed mostly the same throughout this time, no real changes. My weight though was getting dangerously high. I was up to 425 pounds. I decided it was time for a diet and a lifestyle change.

I had lost a lot of weight when I was in high school and college, so I knew the basics of how everything worked. Eat less calories and you'll lose weight. I lost 150 pounds in high school over two years doing this and I figured if I stuck with a diet I could do it again. I went on a strict 1500 calorie diet for one month, I was excited to go see the doctor and see how much weight I had lost (I had no scale at the time to see my progress). When I arrived and stepped on the scale, I was in shock that I had gained one pound (426). How could I be in a 1500 calorie deficit for an entire month and gain one pound?

He did tests to see if there was something wrong with me, thyroid tests, blood tests, and all the routine checks. Nothing was wrong with me. The only explanation he could come up with was the Zoloft potentially causing me to gain/retain weight. At this point I began to give up on the diet and go back to my old ways of being content with what I was.

My grandfather passed away, and I was left with no job, no purpose in my life. As time passed I grew more and more frustrated with my life and my situation, and I wanted to make a change. I felt like the Zoloft was holding me back, so I stopped taking it 3 months ago. Two months later, I started my diet. And within one month of eating 1500 calories a day, I had lost 17 pounds.

The problem was, during that one month, my anxiety and depression were starting to become unbearable. Every day I struggled with feeling anxious. I wanted the weight to come off instantly, I wanted to find a job instantly, I wanted to change my entire life around. And this made me feel so incredibly anxious and depressed that I decided to see my doctor.

He was proud of the weight I had lost, and I told him about my anxiety I had been feeling, and he decided to put me on 150 MG of wellbutrin XL. This is an anti-depressant that is not a SSRI like Zoloft, and one of the most common side effects is weight loss instead of weight gain.

It sounded perfect, an anti-depressant that could help me feel less anxious, depressed, give me a better mood, and not cause me to gain weight? Sign me up. I have been on it for five days so far, and I have not been able to lose any weight at all, I have constant headaches, my chest hurts sometimes, and I can barely sleep. The first two days my mood/energy levels were great and I was less anxious, but the last three days it's felt like there has been little to no changes at all.

I don't know what to do about my mental health and weight anymore. I'm unhappy and depressed because of my weight, but taking anti-depressants causes me to gain weight. I could spend 6 months cycling through medication trying to find the right dose and right medication that doesn't cause weight gain and doesn't cause me to feel like a zombie (zoloft), but I feel like it will just cause me to feel worse.

Maybe the answer is to learn to deal with my depression without medication. Maybe the feeling of anxiety/depression goes away after awhile if you constantly work at it and try to better yourself. Without anti-depressants, life is so much of a struggle, and on anti-depressants, its less of a struggle but I don't actually better myself, I just feel content to be what I am.

I'm at a loss for what I need to do, and this battle of the past five years has really started to wear me down mentally and physically.","I started my weight loss journey at 424 pounds. I've always had struggles with my weight ever since I was a kid, always been the chubby kid growing up. When I was in high school my junior year, I was 370 pounds and went on a diet for 2 years and got all the way down to 220. After graduating college and being unable to find a job, I started to get depressed and discouraged and managed to gain most of the weight back. Over time I've slowly gained more and more weight over the years, dealing with my mental health and other issues. I stopped working, my mother passed away, my grandpa got dementia and I stayed at home to take care of him. I was put on anti-depressants (zoloft) and although I would try half-hearted diets before, I felt like the medicine was preventing me from losing weight so I quit it cold turkey 3 months ago.

Fast forward to one month ago, and I started my diet, and this time I wanted to take it seriously. The first three weeks were great, I got down to 407 pounds and was completely changing what I was eating. More fruit, more vegetables, protein shakes, nuts, and various other healthy meals. I began walking as much as I could every day and slowly it got easier. My anxiety/depression were at a peak during this time, and my doctor suggested I take wellbutrin which I have been on for three days. My mood has been great the past 4 days that I've been on it, and I'm really feeling confident about myself.

The only problem is, the past 5 days I have not lost any weight. One week ago I weighed in at 408.2 and today it's only 407.8. I don't know what has caused this, since the last three weeks I lost nearly 5 pounds a week. I'm still eating in a big calorie deficit (1300-1400 calories per day), but the only difference I made was adding 600 calories worth of food that I would enjoy (for two days it was a subway sandwhich, and the other days it was half a frozen pizza per day). I was still eating my 1400 calories, but 600 of it was more unhealthy (higher sodium/fat) than usual. The other change would be my medication, which is supposed to cause weight loss in most people (why my doctor recommended it to me).

I'm feeling a little discouraged. I want my diet to work and I want to get down to 220 like I was in college, but it seems like losing weight when I'm 30 and not 18 is a much more difficult challenge. At 18, I could eat whatever I wanted as long as I only had 1500 calories and the weight would fly off. But at 30, I have half a pizza and cut my calories by a ton and the scale doesn't move.

What advise would you give someone like me? Should I keep doing what I'm doing and hope the weight loss will continue? Or is there changes I need to accept and more sacrifices I need to make to become a healthier person.","It seems like it would be strong, I ran this comp a lot in beta and won a lot with it, but when ranked came out and the new patch, I felt like it just had too many counters. Red buff/Morello and demons can really shut it down hard. Demons draining mana from your shapeshifters (especially gnar) and not getting the evolve off can make you lose pretty quickly.

I think it's a good strategy but you need to be aware of what your opponents are building as well, since it can be countered by a few things.","Yea the seasonal buffs they've been doing with rorg and now legacy of nightmare is really cool, opens up more options to use cool stuff :)","Yea it's pretty strong, but mostly because of the seasonal buff. If the build couldn't use Justice Lantern+Unity it would lose a ton of toughness and wouldn't be able to push as high.",https://www.d3planner.com/831150968,"https://www.d3planner.com/831150968

Really fun build to play, looking forward to the new season.

https://www.d3planner.com/831150968","Resto shamans are for sure the most desired healer in all of TBC. But most of that is just from their utility like you said. By just pure healing output throughout the whole expansion, in my experience holy priest is usually always number 1.","Prot warrior- Best main tank on most fights, very desired because of cooldowns and pretty good threat generations. Overall best tank for MT situations.

Arms Warrior- Very useful for the 4% global damage debuff, all raids want 1 arm's warrior.

Fury warrior- Fairly low dps until later on in T5+. On cleave type fights, they can top the dps. Single target they will be lower than a lot of classes, but still quite valuable of a class.

Rogues- Average dps in t4-t5, becomes one of the best classes for dps in t6+ only really beat by hunters and warlocks.

Resto druid- Great class with good utility (brez). Most raids will always run 1 resto druid, but 2 isn't bad.

Boomkin- All raids will want to run 1 boomkin, great utility. Improved faire fire for the melee, brez, and 6% crit aura (with epic idol) for your warlocks.

Feral Druid- DPS feral is ok, but average. Feral tank is very good, the best off tank to have. Can generate threat quicker than any tank, utility with brez+crit aura.

Warlocks- Overall the best dps in TBC. Great aoe, good single target, decent utility with soulstone/curses.

Hunters- 2nd best overall dps in TBC. Decent utility (survival hunter you'll want 1 of in every raid, BM hunters give 3% damage boost but usually just to each other). Single target fights they can out dps warlocks, their aoe dps is not so good. Low armor bosses and cleave fights hunters will top the dps, but i'd still put them slightly behind warlocks when it comes to overall top dps in TBC.

Shadow priest- Insane utility. Every raid will want to run 1 shadow priest, 2 isn't bad either.

Disc priest- One of the only specs that is not really used. Certain scenarios where you want pain suppression (hydross comes to mind) is about the only situation you would use a disc priest over holy priest.

Holy priest- by pure HPS, holy priest is probably #1 in tbc. Good AOE healing, good single target, in my opinion they are the full package when it comes to healing in TBC.

Holy paladin- Great tank healing, and provides the paladin buff to the raid. Most raids will run 1 holy paladin.

Prot pally- Every raid will want to run 1 prot pally on most fights. The best aoe tank in the game, good utility.

Ret paladin- Horde they are a bit better due to seal of blood, but even on alliance I'd say most raids will run 1 ret paladin, just for the paladin buff+good utility they offer. Will never really out dps a rogue or fury warrior, but still a class you'd want to have none the less.

Elemental Shaman- Average dps but great utility because of shaman totems/crit buff/bloodlust. Most raids will run 1 with the warlock group.

Resto shaman- Only behind holy priests when it comes to HPS, but the utility they offer makes most raids stack this healer the most. Totems, bloodlust, great aoe healing, fairly decent single target healing makes them very desired. Some raids will run up to 3-4 resto shamans just because they have such great utility while also being one of the stronger healers in TBC.

Enhance shaman- Fairly good damage+great utility. All raids will run at least 1 in the melee group for the 10% attack power buff and improved windfury totems+bloodlust. 

Fire mage- Above average dps in t4-t5, starts to get better in t6. Issue with mages is, other than bringing 1 for the Intellect buff, they start to become just a worse version of a warlock.

Arcane mage- With t5 set bonus, can be the top dps in T5 content. Begins to fall off in t6 behind warlocks.

Frost mage- Above average dps in t4-early t5, falls off hard compared to the other specs after that.


As you can see, almost every class/spec is viable except for a couple. TBC is by far my favorite wow expansion for this reason.","Diablo 2 would be really enjoyable if they just fix some of the limitations put in place from classic bnet. Botting, maphacking, realm downs, and a lot of other issues are really limiting the potential of diablo 2. Hopefully that is something they will considering fixing with the remastered version.","22k files for me, hope this solves my slow load times -.-",Confirmed.,"I have no opinion of the server, because it's only been like 9 hours since it was released, and half of that it was barely playable. So for you to somehow know after 4-5 hours of playing that the server quality is ""easily higher"" than warmane is just a plain stupid statement to make. It takes a lot more than testing 1 class 60-61 to make an accusation like that. ",yea and I'm sure you know already that the server is better quality than warmane by leveling 60-61 in hellfire -.-,quality is easily higher than Warmane... stopped reading there.,"yep that's her buddy, you found her.","I don't really mind that they are having server issues, that's expected. But they are doing an absolute terrible job at communicating with their player base.","I would say that it's more like if you liked vanilla hunter, then you will like TBC hunter even more. They fixed a lot of really dumb things in tbc like the minimum range, traps only being used when out of combat, and a better main ability to use in steady shot. Plus their talents are a bit better designed overall in TBC.","Only stuff I don't hotkey is 30min+ buffs like rockbiter, but yea maybe I should hotkey it.","I know a lot of people will probably think ""so what"" when they watch the video, but as someone who has played countless different private servers over the last few years, I can appreciate the hard work that gummy has put into this server. I'm closing in on level 60 and I've just seen countless things I've never seen on other servers. RP events, mobs using abilities they normally don't use, certain quests that are broken on other servers working on this one, and lots of other minor details. I realize most people don't care about these very minor things, but to me when I see things like that it gives me a lot of confidence in their development team for end game content. If they can put this much effort into minor details that basically no other server bothers with, then I can see the end game becoming just as polished. I'm really looking forward to this servers release, I have high hopes and expectations.","I played to level 30 and I see a huge difference in just the vanilla content alone. On K2 I think I had about 10 combat bugs and a few mobs going into the ground multiple times and a couple quests being bugged by that time. And this was a released server, not a beta.

On nost even 2 years after release the escort quest in redridge was screwed up, or just escort quests in general. Had no issues with the redridge quest on gummies or any escort quest. I think playing all the way to level 30 I had only 1 tiny issue with the entire server which is really really impressive.

MoreSalamander6,"So, I've never dated or been involved with someone in any capacity (I'm a 32 year old guy, by the way). To be honest, I've always struggled to connect ""romantically"" with anyone. Platonically, not much of an issue. My sense of attraction seems a bit... unusual. Actually, I've looked it up, and I believe I may be demisexual, or at least have demisexual tendencies. For those unfamiliar with what that means, basically, I become attracted to people I feel a strong bond or attachment to.

I've only actually been attracted to two women in my entire life. The first was several years ago; there was a girl I worked with, and we worked together for a year or so before I realized I felt something for her. I fell pretty hard, I pursued it, got rejected, took it hard, made things awkward at work, and she kinda grew to dislike me quite a bit. I felt a tremendous amount of regret after that.

The second is a current thing I'm still dealing with. I've fallen pretty hard for the best and closest friend I've ever had, and we couldn't have dated before because she's been in a relationship the entire last few years I've known her, but she recently ended it, and I fell for her. I keep thinking about and wishing I could pursue it, but I really can't imagine she'd ever consider me, so I'm working on trying to suppress these feelings, because I really can't afford to push away my best friend like I did the last girl.

The thing that really scares me is that my family as a whole seems to have a very bad track record with relationships. Every family member that I know ended up with someone just for the sake of having someone instead of no one. There's no ""true love"" that I know of in my family. Even my parents have never loved each other, and are actually quite unhappy with each other. But they've all just ended up with someone because ""having someone is better than having no one"". And because of my dating struggles, and my demisexual tendencies, I fear this is the path I'm on, as well. Well, either that, or just ending up alone altogether.

I play around on dating apps, swiping and swiping, and all I feel is apathy. Even when I get a few sparse matches, the conversation just doesn't go anywhere. And offline, back when I used to have more opportunity to meet new people regularly, there's just never anything between me and another person to escalate to a more than acquaintance level. And now, I have no real opportunities to meet people regularly anymore, especially with the pandemic.

So... I don't know. To be honest, I wouldn't consider myself to be ""depressed"" in general. I'm actually pretty happy and upbeat with my life, it's just the whole subject of dating and romance that really brings me down. I'd put dating out of my mind for the longest time, and I've been pretty happy, but my recent feelings for my friend, and the knowledge that she's going to find someone new in the nearish future has just got me thinking about my own lack of love life again, and it's really bumming me out pretty hard. I was doing okay for so long, not thinking about it, not feeling ""lonely"", and now I'm just thinking about it constantly. I don't know what to do.","Yeah, I hear ya. But, sometimes you kind of just have to ""stay the course"" and ride things out, and that's where I am with most things in life, at the moment. In general, I'm not in a bad place in any other area, not really ""unhappy"" or displeased with anything else going on in my life. And when everything seems to be in a decent place, as it is now, I can't help but focus on the areas that are severely lacking, such as my (lack of) ""love life"".","I mean, I guess, but honestly, my career prospects are probably a lot better if I stay the course with where I am. I can see that there WILL eventually be opportunities, and I've already positioned myself pretty well for them. I just can't quite have them yet. I don't have enough experience to leave and find something good that I can rise up through quickly. If I hold out a little bit for opportunities here, I can gain a lot of valuable experience very easily, and then I can start shopping around for something even better for myself.","Well, I know she doesn't really have any friends to set me up with, so that's kind of a non-starter. I think a lot about whether I could ever ask her out or talk to her about it, but I'm just not sure how she'd react. I don't know if the timing will ever work out, to be honest. I definitely don't think she's ""ready"" for something right now, though she is trying to casually date. But I don't see how I'll ever know the ""right"" time before one of the guys she goes out with a few times becomes a regular, and then it's a done deal.

As for other activities, yeah, maybe, I dunno. Right now, it's tough, because I'm trying to be careful, with the pandemic, and I expect it's going to be a while before life feels ""normal"" and safe again. I've been struggling to come up with things to get involved with that I'm actually interested in. Like, with volunteering, there's not really a ""cause"" I feel strongly enough about to look into. I dunno. Just feels like the older I've gotten, the harder it is to find new ways to meet people.","Well, I'm kind of okay right now with other stuff, because I've been focusing on those things for the last few years more than dating or anything, honestly. I'm not, like, ""done"" working on those things, but I've hit a point where all I can really do right now is bide my time, build experience, and keep an eye out for the next opportunity to move up. So, I'm kind of at a standstill.","I think about it a lot, but I just really don't think she'd see me that way, and I can't afford to lose our friendship over something silly. Besides, her breakup is still fresh, and while she is dating around casually, I just really don't think she'd be ""ready"" to hear something like this anyway.","So, I've never dated or been involved with someone in any capacity (I'm a 32 year old guy, by the way).

I mean, I don't know what, if anything, will happen with her. In any case, I still don't know where that leaves me with everything else, though. :/","Yeah, I've mentioned my attempts at dating apps to her in the past, when she was in her relationship, and she was always encouraging. The one time we hung out after her breakup so far, she was telling me about the dating apps she's using, kinda recommending them, and when I made a joke about how they don't tend to work out so well for me, she mentioned she'd be willing to help me take good pictures and stuff.

I mean, just going by how much she told me about her dating app stuff and the guys she's chatting with, and the couple of dates she's been on, I kind of assume I'm not on her radar, although it was only the first time we'd seen each other post breakup, and I know she's also not really fully ""healed"" from everything, since it had only been a month. So, while I know she's not interested right now, I was more hopeful something could develop in the future, when she's fully moved on. I feel like, after the fact, I did do some things that will maybe help get the ball rolling on getting her to think of me differently, but IF that's a possibility, I think it'll still take some time.","Yeah. I'm not really sure what I'd say, or even how to just start a conversation about any of this out of the blue. Honestly, I get the sense that, if she did feel something for me, much like how I'm worried about what she'd think, I really think she'd also be too scared to tell me how she feels for fear of pushing me away. So, even IF she did feel something for me, I suspect she would never let on unless I said something first.

It is tough suppressing my feelings for her, but I'm not so sure I have any other choice. I'm not looking forward to the time when one of her dates becomes a regular thing and then a relationship, as I don't know how I'll feel then. That said, I don't know whether her next relationship will be a ""rebound"", so perhaps it would be for the best if she did date someone else for now, to get that out of her system. I dunno.","Yeah. I know she'd be there for me. I always just hate feeling like I'm ""whining"" about how lonely I am. And knowing that I'm struggling with feelings for her right now, I'm not sure it would be particularly easy to talk about my dating fears while having these feelings for her in the back of my mind, yanno?","I dunno. She and I had a couple discussions about me and my prospects a couple years ago, and I kinda expressed some of my concerns (though not necessarily the idea of ""settling"", I can't really remember what I said, at this point), and she reassured me. We haven't really talked about that stuff since then, though, partially because I had put it out of my mind for a while, and partially because I just make myself feel bad for dumping my own issues on other people too much.","Yeah, I dunno. I've tried plenty of apps and dating sites, over the years, but it's just always the same thing. Few matches, and the ones that I do get just don't want to talk to me much or at all.

Meeting people in person has also been extremely difficult, because I'm very introverted and reserved, so I'm not the type to just strike up a conversation with a random stranger, and I don't typically ""meet"" people unless I'm meeting someone through someone else. Which doesn't happen all that often anymore.

I like to think I'm self-aware of my issues enough to not end up like my family, but the reality is... I hate being ""alone"", and I think if I get a chance to ""settle"", I'm most likely going to take it. I can kind of feel that deep down inside me, unfortunately.","So, I've never dated or been involved with someone in any capacity. To be honest, I've always struggled to connect ""romantically"" with anyone. Platonically, not much of an issue. My sense of attraction seems a bit... unusual.

And because of my dating struggles, and my demisexual tendencies, I fear this is the path I'm on, as well. Well, either that, or just ending up alone altogether.

And that really scares me. The thing is, I'm sure if I looked hard enough, I could find at least one or two women that would be willing to date me. But what if I can't come to truly ""love"" them? What if they're just someone who's available to me, and ""good enough"" because ""having someone is better than having no one""? As badly as I want to be with someone, the idea of dating as ""normal"" people do it just really doesn't excite me or inspire anything in me. I like the way I've felt about the two women I've been attracted to in my life (well, the way I felt before I screwed up with the first one, anyway). They made me feel something beyond pure apathy. That's the way I WANT to feel about someone, about dating in general. But I just don't.

I play around on dating apps, swiping and swiping, and all I feel is apathy. ""Eh, I guess..."". I've never actually been on a date, let alone from dating apps, but it's always so nothing to me. Even when I get a few sparse matches, the conversation just doesn't go anywhere. And offline, back when I used to have more opportunity to meet new people regularly, there's just never anything between me and another person to escalate to a more than acquaintance level.

To be honest, I'd put dating out of my mind for the longest time, and I've been pretty happy, but my recent feelings for my friend, and the knowledge that she's going to find someone new in the nearish future has just got me thinking about my own lack of love life again, and it's really bumming me out pretty hard. I was doing okay for so long, not thinking about it, not feeling ""lonely"", and now I'm just thinking about it constantly. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR - I've never been able to date, there's only two women I've ever wanted to date in my entire life, and my family has a history of ""settling"" into bad relationships. I'm really worried I'm going to end up like them or just end up alone.","Well, yeah, I don't mean that I'm ""tired of being friends"", I just mean I'm tired of always ""just"" making friends and nothing more. Does that make sense? It's just frustrating feeling so ""alone"". I've definitely been around on dating apps and sites a bit over the years, and I'll continue looking, but I've just never been able to get anything off the ground with anyone on them.

I made a couple dumb little jokes to my friend when we last hung out, but I couldn't really read her reactions to get a good read on it.","Yeah, at the moment, I don't even know how to go about meeting people and making new friends anymore. Especially with the pandemic. Even then, I used to make plenty of acquaintances when I was younger, but that's all it ever ended up at. So, more friends are always nice, sure. I'm just tired of only having that.

As for my friend, I wouldn't want to be rash, although she is already doing some casual dating. I'm sure she'll find someone fairly quickly, as she's very likable. But, given how much she's told me about her attempts to date post-break up, I do think that's a pretty strong indicator that I'm nowhere on her romantic radar.","I'm really worried I'm going to either end up like the rest of my family, or end up alone...

So, I've never dated or been involved with someone in any capacity (32M, by the way). To be honest, I've always struggled to connect ""romantically"" with anyone. Platonically, not much of an issue. My sense of attraction seems a bit... unusual. Actually, I've looked it up, and I believe I may be demisexual, or at least have demisexual tendencies. For those unfamiliar with what that means, basically, I become attracted to people I feel a strong bond or attachment to.

I've only actually been attracted to two women in my entire life. The first was several years ago; there was a girl I worked with, and we worked together for a year or so before I realized I felt something for her. I fell pretty hard, I pursued it, got rejected, took it hard, made things awkward at work, and she kinda grew to dislike me quite a bit. I felt a tremendous amount of regret after that.

The second is a current thing I'm still dealing with. I've fallen pretty hard for the best and closest friend I've ever had, and we couldn't have dated before because she's been in a relationship the entire last few years I've known her, but she recently ended it, and I fell for her. I keep thinking about and wishing I could pursue it, but I really can't imagine she'd ever consider me, so I'm working on trying to suppress and kill off these feelings, because I really can't afford to push away my best friend like I did the last girl.

The thing that really scares me is that my family as a whole seems to have a very bad track record with relationships. Every family member that I know ended up with someone just for the sake of having someone instead of no one. There's no ""true love"" that I know of in my family. Even my parents have never loved each other, and are actually quite unhappy with each other. But they've all just ended up with someone because ""having someone is better than having no one"". And because of my dating struggles, and my demisexual tendencies, I fear this is the path I'm on, as well. Well, either that, or just ending up alone.

And that really scares me. The thing is, I'm sure if I looked hard enough, I could find at least one or two women that would be willing to date me. But what if I can't come to truly ""love"" them? What if they're just someone who's available to me, and ""good enough"" because ""having someone is better than having no one""? As badly as I want to be with someone, the idea of dating as ""normal"" people do it just really doesn't excite me or inspire anything in me. I like the way I've felt about the two women I've been attracted to in my life (well, the way I felt before I screwed up with the first one, anyway). That's the way I WANT to feel about someone, about dating in general. But I just don't.

I play around on dating apps, swiping and swiping, and all I feel is apathy. ""Eh, I guess..."". I've never actually been on a date, let alone from dating apps, but it's always so nothing to me. Even when I get a few sparse matches, the conversation just doesn't go anywhere. And offline, back when I used to have more opportunity to meet new people regularly, there's just never anything between me and another person to escalate to a more than acquaintance level. And now, I have no real opportunities to meet people regularly anymore, especially with the pandemic.

So... I don't know. To be honest, I'd put dating out of my mind for the longest time, and I've been pretty happy, but my recent feelings for my friend, and the knowledge that she's going to find someone new in the nearish future has just got me thinking about my own lack of love life again, and it's really bumming me out pretty hard. I was doing okay for so long, not thinking about it, not feeling ""lonely"", and now I'm just thinking about it constantly. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR - I've never been able to date, I've only wanted to date two women in my life, and my family has a history of ""settling"" into bad relationships. I'm really worried I'm going to end up like them or just end up alone.","I don't really know what I ""want"", at this point. I just hate feeling this turmoil the way I am.","While I'm not trying to argue that I might still have a chance, I don't think I've necessarily ""blown"" anything. When I met her, she was already in her previous relationship, they were living together, and she expected she was going to marry and have kids with him. So, nothing was going to happen between me and her early on, because she wasn't going to dump her boyfriend, kick him out, and start dating me instead.

Even now, in the 5-6 weeks she's been out of her relationship, she and I have only hung out once, and I'm certainly not going to try to just swoop in when she's just ended a 5 year relationship at the first chance I get.

So, like I said, I'm not arguing that I have a chance, but I also think it's unfair to say I ""blew it"". We haven't even had enough time to readjust our friendship after everything, yet. And in the one time I hung out with her, I wasn't some dopey ""not confident"" mess. She even complimented me and pointed out how well I got along with her family that day, especially in comparison to her ex.

Either way, I know that I do need to move on, and I'm trying to, it's just difficult, especially when dating is nigh impossible for me to begin with.","Yeah. That's a lovely story, and part of me wishes mine could go that way. I dunno. She's so hard to read, in that way. In the 5-6 weeks since she ended her five year relationship, we've only actually hung out once, across a weekend. The first day definitely felt very platonic and like I'm definitely ""just a friend"", as she vented a lot about her ex, and also told me a lot about how she's on dating apps and is chatting with a bunch of guys and going on same dates, though she said she's looking more for distractions right now.

The second day, there was still some of that, too, but she and I also had some nice moments, and there were little things that made me wonder.

So, I don't know. I hate the idea of suppressing my feelings and never letting myself have a chance, but I also don't want to lose the one good friend I've ever had by being stupid.

It's even tougher to read because she's been friendly with guys that have blatantly pursued her that she's shot down, but she's also told me about guys she dropped because she felt like they were just hovering and biding their time to get a chance with her. I don't want her to feel like I'm one of those guys, and I don't want her to think our entire friendship has been a lie.

I don't know how to appropriately tell her any of this while minimizing the damage it could do to the friendship.

I also don't know when the right time would be. I feel it's a bit soon to ""swoop in"" right after her relationship ended, but she is casually dating, and who knows when something could stick. Something else very difficult also just popped up in her life yesterday. I don't want to pile on another difficulty of having to deal with a possible end of a good friendship. Especially with the holidays right around the corner, too. I dunno.","To be honest, I don't think it's even occurred to her whether or not her next guy will be accepting of me. I think we were all very fortunate about the context of her last relationship in that me and the ex got along well and had a friendly relationship. And while she's indicated to me many times that she absolutely wants me in her life long term, I don't think she realizes right now that finding another guy that's going to be accepting of that is probably going to be a challenge.

I'm not so much worried about her rejecting my advances, as I anticipate that to be true, anyway. I just really don't want to lose her, because I've never had a friend like her before, and I don't want to go back to the way my life was before she came along. It was quite terrible. But yeah, I am worried that we're on a timer no matter what.","I wouldn't say I believe I need to be ""madly in love"" with someone in order to date them. But, I also don't want to go into dates feeling apathetic, either, and that's how I generally feel about people I've met. Ideally, I want to date someone that I have at least some basic interest in and/ or connection with.

And it's just scary, because I've seen a lot of people, particularly within my own family, who end up with someone just because they're available to them. And their relationships seem sad and loveless, like they're more a matter of ""This was better than being alone"". And I don't want that. I want to actually love the person I'm with and feel happy that we're in each other's lives. And given my inability to develop connections beyond ""acquaintances"", I'm worried that any relationship I do end up in will be doomed to be one of those ""I guess this is good enough"" scenarios.","Well, like I said, I get what you're saying, but I just feel like, in the end, my intentions will be good. I'm not going to undermine her future relationships, I'm not going to pressure her or anything, I'm not going to do anything that I think would sow any seeds of doubt about our friendship in her mind.

Yeah, it's going to be tough for me, personally, to deal with these feelings in the background, but I don't intend to hurt her in any way, to the best of my ability.","I know, and I get it, I just... Regardless of how I feel, I really do care about her, and want her to be happy, and I wouldn't ever do anything to hurt her. So, I get how these feelings can create negativity, but underneath it all, I do value and respect her, and I'll always do my best to do right by her.","Eh. She has no reason to think that I feel anything for her right now. I've never given her any indication to think that, and we've only even hung out once since her breakup (the time period where I started feeling something). She's not ""using"" me for attention, and I wouldn't say I'm ""in love"" with her.

I just have strong feelings, and I'm trying to get a handle on it, because I really don't want to ruin things. She's the best and closest friend I've ever had, and I really don't feel like I can afford to lose her, and I'd never do anything to hurt her or anything. At the end of the day, I do want what's best for her, I'm just trying to deal with stuff on my end as best I can.","Yeah, I guess. But if I do my best to not let it out, and to not actually be ""manipulative"", I don't see how it hurts her.","Well, if I never say or do anything about it, is it actually unfair to her? Seems like I'm the only one who would really lose out in that situation, and, I mean... that might be okay, if that's what it comes down to.","Either way, I don't want to stop being friends. She's too important to me, and I've never had a friend as good as her.","I mean, she hasn't specifically told me that, but I am assuming as much, based on everything."
westonhermann,"I don’t post too much on Reddit, but I don’t really have anyone in my life that quite understands where I’m at. Does anyone else find a weird kind of comfort in the thought of dying? 

I’m atheist so I don’t believe in any sort of afterlife. the “nothingness” I’m expecting after death is sounding more and more appealing as the days go by. Everyone around me is always so happy, and they’re able to recover from shitty things fairly quickly, and I just can’t. It makes me feel really isolated.
 
I haven’t been able to have normal thoughts in a while. My entire mind is just totally consumed, almost obsessed with the thought of dying. I drive a lot, my commute to work and school is long, and recently I’ve been just totally zoning out daydreaming about crashing my car or whatnot. 

I hate myself for things that are out of my control. I’ve got a lot of mental Illness issues that I’ve been dealing with since birth. I have Tourette’s, borderline, and ocd all pretty bad. I just want it all to stop. I know it’s selfish to make those kind of decisions, but I don’t know where else to turn.",Why do I know people that look like that,"This happened at a Home Depot in McHenry county, Illinois a couple miles from where I live. It baffles me that people around here would act like this. People in my area are usually so nice, and peaceful. Shame on her, and shame on people that think it’s okay to behave like this,",Oh boy,r/thanksihateit,"How the fuck do leap years work? That shit is so confusing to me, but everyone around me seems to understand it.",2.60 in buttfuck Illinois,r/thathappened,Is there any good way to get a stranglehold on it?? It seriously gets in the way.,"I just can’t stop, none of the things I’m lying about are ever important, they’re things that literally have no impact. Or I’ll exaggerate points for no reason. It gets in the way of my relationships because someone will call me out, and I either realize it and apologize, or I feel attacked and I try and defend myself, but just end up digging myself deeper. Anyone else have this problem?",Use those cotton balls to wipe some of the oil off your fucking face. My blind cousin could read your face man.,I don’t even know where to fucking start with this one.,Instagram vagina,r/niceguys,You should actually go visit r/jokes. You won’t regreddit,r/whoosh ? Not sure if this is satire lmao,Cheese butthole,Happy Christmas y’all!,r/quityourbullshit,"Thank you so much for the feedback! It means a lot. My mom is not my therapist, I don’t actually see a therapist. The health insurance my mom gets through her work doesn’t cover a majority of them. I’ve been searching on my own, and trying to find someone close by, but options are pretty limited around here. 

I definitely don’t get enough sleep. That does keep coming up, and I do try to get to bed early as often as I can. My diet could use some work too lol. There are 100% some much needed lifestyle changes I could make to make it easier on myself. 

Another issue is, I am 1000% extroverted. I love people, I love talking to people, and I work with people. I don’t usually have borderline issues with people I don’t see everyday, the people I struggle with are the people that I’m always surrounded by. My girlfriend, parents, siblings, etc. I get depressed and irritable when I’m not meeting my social interaction quota.","I’m almost 18 years old, and I feel really stuck. My mom is a therapist, and I’ve got borderline pretty bad. It feels counterintuitive, but living with a therapist has made coping, and focusing on improving really hard. I have to start by saying that there were benefits that came out of my situation. I feel like I’m pretty good at identifying when a feeling is coming from my borderline or from real emotions, but I have a really hard time stopping them despite that. The feelings are really overwhelming and easily trump reasonable thoughts. I’m good at talking about it, and I don’t feel the need to get defensive about it when I’m not spiraling. I can sit down with my girlfriend and acknowledge that I was being unreasonable after the fact, but definitely not in the moment. The issue lies in where I’m at now. Although I am borderline, I still have reasonable criticisms, and they aren’t always a result of spiraling thoughts. I feel like I can’t have criticisms without it being immediately shut down and blamed on my bpd. As I mentioned earlier, I’ve got a girlfriend. We’ve been together for almost 2 years, and she is fully aware of the borderline. I make it a point that if she ever feels trapped with me, that she tells me, so we can work it out and figure out what’s making her feel that way. I’m pretty paranoid with her, it was really bad when we first started dating, but the longer we were together the better I got at recognizing how patient and clearly committed she is. My girlfriend is fantastic and she’s never given me a reason to have any mistrust, but borderline does it’s borderline thing and every time something feels off I spiral into thoughts about her cheating and it tears me apart. I do a pretty good job of not projecting it most of the time. I can keep it in my head and work it out reasonably after a while. But they are CONSTANT, and they drag my days out. By the end of the day I can get pretty cranky. There are periods of time where I can go hours without them being to bad, and I have days where I feel really good. But the bad days are really bad. I really want this to go away, I want to feel more comfortable interacting and I really want to trust my girlfriend. What can I do to stop the thoughts? I know it’ll probably get better as I get older, but I’m really worried it won’t.",That’s not how debate works buddy.,"False. first of all, although the writings in the article might be real, that IS a bias source. Second, that entire article was a series of writings that only proved that Christianity existed then as well as now. We know people have believed in god for millennia. That doesn’t prove his existence.","But i can say with certainty that we cannot verify all of the stories surrounding his life. We might know that he existed, but we can by no means be sure of any of the things he accomplished.","I do not doubt that Julius Caesar existed. Unlike god, We know what Caesar looked like, we have actual artifacts that confirm his existence, and he invented a calendar and a form of government that existed for hundreds of years.","We also have no way of confirming ancient history with 100% certainty. You ever play telephone in school growing up? Information changes, and skews as time passes, we know that for a fact."

Lanin_X,"Hi everyone! My name is Alex and I’m the creator of a mood tracker for smartphones. I’ve always believed that all changes in the external world always begin with some shifts within a person. At least, it was exactly my story: the desire to solve my own problems and help others in this challenging task led me to the creation of a compact digital “psychologist” which will not only analyze your mental state but also give some recommendations. But first things first.

People, their relationship with each other and with the outside world - that’s exactly what I’ve always been interested in. And they felt it: friends and family had been constantly seeking my help. They did not hesitate to share with me some experiences that they would never have told others. I knew a lot about their problems in relationships, with family, at work, and always tried to help with advice. But the fact that I was a sensitive person didn’t work in my favor. I felt that I couldn’t cope with all the burden of my own problems, and, unlike my friends, I had no one to share my pains with.

At some point, I realized that the state of my mental health was close to depression. I didn't even have the strength to get out of bed. Every day I had to force myself to do basic things: brush my teeth, cook breakfast, go to university, or work. I tried to contact psychologists, but this experience was extremely negative - I can share it another time if you are interested. Therefore, I thought that it would be nice to create a pocket psychologist - a digital assistant which would always be in touch, friendly, and helpful. At first, my ideas were somewhere in the field of website development, but then I realized that a smartphone would be a perfect platform for this as it was always at hand.

I interviewed my acquaintances and found out that some of them used the bullet journal. But this method had a significant drawback - you had to fill in all trackers for the next week/month/year by hand. And if you lost your diary, it was a disaster! Using a mobile application is much easier: you just spend a couple of minutes - and that’s it.

My friends had already used similar apps, but there you had just to choose the mark of mood and activities you were involved in that day, and nothing else. We decided to supplement and improve our application: we added questions, the ability to reflect and analyze the state of mental health. 

## What is special about our app?

To stand out among the apps already on the market, we decided to base the app’s work on the famous ABC method. It’s a part of cognitive-behavioral therapy, that assumes the fact that a person's thoughts and attitudes affect their emotions and behavior. With the help of awareness, you can transform negative beliefs, change the behavior, and emotional state.

The ABC model assumes that events are recorded in the following order:

A - Activating Event, also called ""Trigger"",

B - Beliefs/Thoughts and attitudes (thoughts that occur in response to an activating event),

C - Consequences (how people feel and behave when they have these thoughts Consequences are divided into two parts: reactions and emotions.

The app allows to indicate what mood you are in today, and, according to the state you noted, asks leading questions, like “What do you think about the situation?” etc.

By keeping a diary of your emotions regularly, you can trace patterns and understand what causes anxiety, irritation, or stress. Sometimes the results are unexpected - after I started using the app myself, I stopped meeting an old friend of mine, realizing that I was emotionally drained after this communication. Moreover, until that moment I hadn’t ever thought about it!

Personally,  I really like the Moments feature - these are notes from the past and your random photos that appear daily. They cheer me up a lot - it's so nice to remember sweet moments with friends and family. You never know what you'll get! 

And as for practices - the new feature of our app - I tried them all on myself and, it seems, that I became more tolerant of others. I care more about my mental health and understand this world a little better.

By the way, now we are working on a global update - the creation of a chatbot that predicts mood and analyzes things you should avoid or pay attention to. Its tips are based on your notes and mood/trigger marks, and the bot is constantly learning.

*It seems to me that diaries and mood trackers have always been relevant, especially now, in pandemic 2020. Keeping notes is really helpful: your diary can be a creative laboratory, a caring psychotherapist, a source of memories, a tool for self-development, and most importantly, a reliable hideaway at the same time.*

Our journal is more suitable for modern realities - it inspires you when you feel unable to write, draws conclusions, and shows statistics. The app regularly sends you reminders so that you don’t forget to use it daily.

The app is available on AppStore and it’s free.

We continue creating products for health and creativity, and we will definitely tell you about them in the following publications. You can ask me any questions about mental health, application development, or just about life :) I am not a professional psychologist, but I am very interested in this area and I am open to new information and suggestions.

Some Producthunt.com users expected our application to be different :-) Besides, there is a namesake video chat, and sometimes you come up with it instead of our app. But we still decided to leave the name JOI! Our users are used to it and many still associate it exclusively with our application. We can say that this name already has its own soul.

It's also lowering your base dopamine levels. Killing your motivation to do anything. It's raising your standards. You will only want to fuck 7+ girls. I am being 100% serious here. You have to realize if you are addicted to today's porn you won't talk to girls. It is rewiring your brain to become a coomer. You would have to stop for months to reverse these effects. But good luck on that. 

Don't believe me. Try fapping without porn or with only your imagination. You will have no desire to even do that. You would rather not fap than fap to imagination.

Just now, for example, I was reading posts about nurses feeling overwhelmed by people suffering from COVID-19 and couldn’t help but feel cold to their struggles with people dying. My thoughts were something along the lines of “if you can’t deal with it anymore, than why did you choose this type of life?” and “if you can’t handle all this than quit!” I know those statements sound cold, but those were pretty much my thoughts at the time. Also I’m noticing how when someone feels depressed or suicidal online I feel like saying “oh shut the hell up” or “bitch please”. But I’ve never actually said any of these things either online or out loud irl mainly because I’m probably a coward. These thoughts were nothing more than thoughts and not something I’ve actually said. Maybe I don’t really have depression anymore. Maybe I’m just an asshole. Maybe I truly am a bad person.

Cain killed Abel and then ran off with who again to create the human race?” He was then sent to the principals office because of that.

Anyways, Jesus appears to me with a serious look on his face and says something along the lines of Catholics being the true Christians and those who are not catholic will either go to purgatory or hell. I can’t really remember the exact words sorry. I told my then minister about this dream on a Sunday and he brushed it off as just a dream and that Jesus would never say anything like that. Now I’m not trying to cause a raucous amongst Christians of different denominations, this dream came to mind just now after all these years and I’m just curious as to what this all means.",Yay!!!,Bighorn Fire.,No. Just an observer.

On a practical  note, can you make it mandatory for your students to turn on their cameras and mics during your classes and encourage them to ask questions? Maybe they are getting negative vibes from you and they are either disinterested (due to your own low mood which could be affecting how you come across to your students) or scared/intimidated and don't want to speak up. I'm just hazarding a guess here.

Do speak to a therapist if you can. Alternately, is there another trusted teacher you can talk to? Maybe they might be having similar experiences?

Previously, I always added water to the pellets but now that the weather is getting warmer (I'm in the southern hemisphere so we're getting close to summer), I had to stop wetting the pellets because the food was starting to spoil after a few hours.

My quails seem to either be not eating, or eating a lot less than they used to. Should I wait and see if they will start eating the dry pellets? I'm not sure if they are having trouble swallowing the pellets, they are just standard game bird pellets and should be small enough for them to swallow. Do you think it would help if I ground the pellets into a powder? I used to do that when they were chicks but now they are 6 months old and I think they should be able to swallow them whole.

My birds are not the brightest and I don't even know if they even recognise dry pellets as food.

hanamilove,"do you think that perhaps you also self-perpetuate this narrative after you meet a group of new people (not asking from a judgmental perspective only thinking out loud)? i am very similar in that i feel like nobody would give a damn if say tomorrow i dropped off the face of the earth but i also recognize this is the story i've always told myself and its 90 percent based on just the pesky little voices in my head rather than reality and hard facts. after you meet people the next day do you think 'well they don't want to get to know me any further so that was it back to the same old routine of making useless connections that never go deeper'?

i know there are also ways in which i act that may turn somebody off and i am always trying to be mindful of what i say and how it comes across. and that's taken a lot of work. that being said, i'll always be far from perfect and i won't be everyone's cup of tea. And that's fine. But now I sit with myself after I have met someone and then separate the facts from the self-sabotaging thoughts. And then I follow up if I felt a connection, even if the other person doesn't. Be a main character if you want to feel like one. Passive living opens yourself up to just reacting to other people's energies I think. 

 If you haven't done that you can spend some time looking inwards, studying yourself and examining your past but apart from that, make sure you aren't hurting  yourself with incorrect storylines (not saying you do but)

Joseph Campbell says ""I don't see the world as it is. I see the world as I am"".

I see posts on here about those that have just lost a loved one, and almost always delete my responses before I am able to post them. It's like I don't have much to give, because I myself am not in a place of belief or strength. So my condolences feel phoney. It feels heartbreaking and I feel helpless when I read about those who have just lost someone. But I don't have the words to express anything.

Sometimes I see interviews (I sound very naive - yes, i know interviews are when people put their best foot forward) and when people talk about how losing a loved one gave them an appreciation of life, it makes me feel so lost. I don't feel like my mom's there guiding me. All I know is she isn't here anymore. I quit my career to become her caregiver and now that I am trying to get back into the professional world, I am trying to switch careers but I don't even know for sure what I am going to end up in or if I am going to do well at all.

My brother would do similiar things but then take a hiatus from drinking (I guess that helps him stay in denial. He’s able to prove to himself he doesn’t have an alcohol problem...). Then he would have one beer and say it was just one I’m good. But then he’d start having one every other day. Then he would have more and more until he shows up as the drunk asshole he turns into when he has more than a few and at this point, we just don’t say anything. He lies. We stay silent. He drinks but doesn’t engage. We stay silent. We just don’t have anything left in us. We lost our mom four months ago and we’re all just depleted.

Slater-Slater,"I have opened up to family and talked to a doctor a few months ago, and despite being very blunt telling them “I do not want to live anymore” neither option saw any results or referrals to professionals. I have had severe family issues that started earlier this year when my parents split up on my 18th birthday. Ever since things have gotten worse, involving everything from drugs/alcohol issues up to threats of violence. I have had thoughts of just leaving, even if that meant me being homeless, but these did not last long. I have a younger sister that I feel tremendous guilt over for her having to be born into this world. When I have thoughts of suicide the thought of leaving her behind destroys me. Whenever I have thoughts of running away I realise that she would just take my place. I came to the conclusion that if I stuck around the toxicity maybe I could shield some of it from her. 

Overall I am scared for my sister and I’s future. I would prefer a life where we are both able to find success and happiness in our own ways but I doubt that is likely. I feel terribly guilty that I was able to grow up with a good childhood where my parents were still sane and have great memories, and instead she will have childhood memories of her loveless parents that didn’t give her what she deserved. I would trade places any day.

I am living in hell. Every night I go to sleep thinking how the next day going to worse and I am always right. New family problems arise almost daily that leave me hopeless. It has taken a toll on my physical health too, where I now have random chest flutters during the day that the doctor ruled down to being due to stress.

This isn’t a situation where I am down for no reason, in fact I can name many reasons that lead me to this state of mind leaving me to believe that anti-depressants won’t help.

Cleet / Javier
The first of the three hunted down, with both being the smaller and more sympathetic characters. Both have the option to be killed or spared and even if spared, they both are killed soon afterwards. Both are used to give up information before being killed. 

Joe / Bill
The second of the three hunted down, with both being the larger and less intelligent characters. Both are killed by John (although Bill can be killed by Reyes instead, the option to spare is not clearly displayed to the player like Javier) Joe can be seen standing alongside two allies, parallel to when we see Bill for the first time in RDR1 standing beside two allies with guns drawn. 

Micah / Dutch
The final enemy to be hunted down. Both are confronted on a snowy mountain top after their gangs have been taken out. Both confrontations are more philosophical than physical. Both deaths are at the hands of Dutch after being cornered by John (Micah is shot by Dutch / Dutch commits suicide) After both confrontations John retires to his ranch, Beecher’s Hope.","Walt didn’t give a shit about his family’s status after he died, his motivation was his desire to show the world how tough he was.

Let me start by saying this: I have sleep issues. I have sleep apnea and insomnia. I use a CPAP machine and take medication for insomnia (prescription) on an as needed basis. So I know that part of my issue has to do with lack of quality hours of sleep. I rarely, if ever, wake up feeling refreshed. No matter how much sleep I get.

I immediately begin to think about what tasks I can cancel or move to another date the moment I wake up.  I even think about the  tasks I have scheduled for other days and think about cancelling those as well.  This feeling normally lasts for the first 2-3 hours of my day.  

Does anyone else experience this?  If so, can you provide some help?  No matter how much I try to excite myself the night before for the next day to come to be productive and work on goals, most mornings I wake up the exact opposite.",Interested.  I have the set.

Have you watched Chandler's pirate ship disaster?","First question and we can go from there.  Have you watched this sermon yet?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0aB1lolHn0","Well.  I can safely say I've listened to 100+ Chandler sermons.  He's been one of my favorite preachers.  If you trace the last year or so, you can watch the change in his style and theology.  "
xcer49,"Hi, so I’ve already been diagnosed a while ago, and I’m on medication for both that and GAD. Lately I’ve been experiencing what I want to say is a lack of a will to do anything, but, I have reasoning behind it. 

(TL;DR at bottom)

So here’s some background for context, because I don’t know if what I’m feeling is depression or just a reasonable given the situation: 

 I’m in college and switched into a difficult major halfway through. This is my fifth year; scheduled to graduate after four more semesters. I’m very ready to be done with the whole school environment. It’s been a constant cycle of hard work that doesn’t seem to be enough, being too busy (partially my fault- I tend to overcommit but I also feel it’s necessary to be successful in the field), getting stressed out, and not getting enough sleep/exercise/etc. So honestly pretty typical. But four more semesters on top of the nine already is just exhausting to think about, esp given that the classes get harder. 

I also work part time- it’s an internship, but I also have it because it helps pay the bills, which are piling up. My husband and I have both been dealing with medical bills, even with his parents’ help (which is awesome that they help, btw. We’re lucky for that). He struggles with an undiagnosed illness that looks like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome mixed with MS. His mom has MS so it’s suspicious. Because of this, he’s only able to do class part time. He used to have full schedules plus a lucrative internship- it just isn’t possible anymore.
Li
Additionally, I’m not on speaking terms with half my immediate family due to abusive issues. That finally culminated last fall, and really added on to stress and such. From time to time I still have to defend myself against family members I do talk to. The defending involves a lot of guilt tripping and things you’d find on r/raisedbynarcissists .

My internship is at a steam turbine power plant. My passion is towards energy engineering and somehow stopping/preventing/reversing(?) climate change. It’s incredibly sad to me to see permanent changes happening to the planet and tbh gives me anxiety to think about. So I want to do what I can to try to help. Having just started this position last fall, it’s been very exciting, because it’s a great gateway into the field I want to work in. The job is flexible and I can focus studies & research on efficiency of pretty much anything in the plant. Which is awesome! What’s disheartening is that through my training and increase of energy knowledge, the answer to some sort of solution is so much more complicated than it seemed before. And everything takes money, of course. What if we don’t actually have the resources to stop this, and it’s a lost cause? 

This has been on my mind recently. Added to that is a fundamental constitutional disagreement in the club that I help lead that I have strong feelings about. So that’s a bit more stress

All of this pretty much wore me out a bit last fall. But then, my husband and I had a really nice break for the past couple weeks, away from all of it, where we got to spend time with his loving family. It was so helpful.

Came back from that, and went to work for almost a full work week. Back to the grind of things. And now that it’s the weekend I just... I don’t want to do anything. I don’t think I have the energy to do anything. I have things I want to get done, but I don’t even have a positive mindset that they will get done. So I’m currently talking about the past couple days, but this is something I experienced on quite a few Saturdays last semester as well.

I don’t see the _point_ in doing anything. Right now, I just don’t see any victories. Last fall was decently successful but I don’t see these plans going well. School is fine but I’m not a naturally good student; just got off academic probation. I’m worried about my coming classes. 

I hope it doesn’t sound entitled but I don’t see a lot of positive things in the near future. Working/studying 24/7, dealing with med issues and helping husband, dealing with family members, working towards a purpose that looks bleak as I barely even start; plus the current world drama, I guess.

Point is, I don’t want to do anything mostly because I don’t see any of it ending well anyways. Do you think that’s a normal reaction? Or part of the symptoms of the depression I’m fighting against?

There’s more but I’m going to end it there. 

TL;DR I have little to no motivation, but I don’t know if it’s due to depression or because I’m dealing with a lot of stress and disheartening circumstances. Thoughts or advice?","Trying to figure out if I should come home today from STL or stay here. I’m personally in the area at College Park and Stadium. I heard there’s a lot of power out.

Thanks for the help!","I’m a college student and I just spent $2,000 fucking dollars on an endoscopy to see why I’m having constant stomach pains, nausea, and diarrhea. Want to guess the result?

Absolutely nothing wrong! No ulcers, no inflammation, not even old healed ulcers. I am 100% fucking HEALTHY.

And now, because of that, I’m going to be going to school full time and working at least 20 hours a week. I study engineering, and while some people are good at it, I am not. I have family I like to visit on weekends. That’s not happening. I’m a leader of a club. That’s gotta go away. 
I’m also married, and that’s not a problem, but my husband has his own undiagnosed issues that look a lot like MS- extreme fatigue and his legs buckle and fail a lot. So I try to help out with him. So basically what I’m saying is a lot of time just went down the drain so I could get this ABSOLUTELY USELESS procedure.

First off, I truly apologize if I’m misunderstanding or mislabeling anything. I’m not very knowledgeable on the subject but earnestly interested in learning. 

I remember hearing once that being transgender is different than liking the idea of another gender... I think (not as in a relationship way). Now I’m a bit confused. Is there a difference between wishing you could be and actively wanting to be a different gender? Besides acting on it?

Also, I’ve been having what feels like it could be dysphoria. I’m sorry if I’m getting this wrong, and please correct me. But it’s a deep self loathing. A lot of stuff feels wrong. Even lately I’ve been getting a feeling in my gut that something is fundamentally and deeply wrong or out of place. This could be instead related to anxiety, but I’m not sure. 

I like the idea of being male, while I currently identify as female. The thing is though, I don’t see that fitting in my life. I have a husband who I love dearly, but I don’t see myself being a man married to him (however he is and has been 100% supportive, and would not want to leave if anything were to change). I don’t see my life involving me being a guy. I know logically it wouldn’t be too late, seemingly ever (and I’m also only in my early twenties). But I have plans and hopes and such. And I’d like to have children, too.

Should I... drop the idea? And if so, any advice on dealing with this feeling that I’m having (dysphoria or not)? Am I not across the line (that may or may not exist)?

I should also mention that my sex drive is... there but not easily accessible? Like I never feel sexy or anything, in my body. I’m decently healthy and stuff but it kinda grosses me out but I don’t know why.

Edit: Thank you for the responses! I appreciate it.","Coming from a Christian of eight years, questioning what I do and don’t believe. In other aspects of my life I’m tired of dealing with untruths and cover ups and basically any hushness. I want truth. I’m hungry for truth, and I just see so many people (not necessarily Christians) beating around the bush to possibly make themselves feel better? Or for other reasons which I don’t know. So for anyone who’s willing to get dirty and talk about knowing truth, that’s what I’m kind of asking. Ps I do know a lot of scripture, if you post some as a comment it’s not going to “convince” me or anything. Trust me on that one.","Not looking for scripture as examples for why we should love God or why God is good.

And yeah, there’s the “well if you try hard enough anything’s possible!” thought process. But with higher intelligence comes more ability and capacity for understanding.

[Text with Mom-](https://imgur.com/a/sA1wJl0) 

This is really funny to me but it’s just because this happens so commonly and SO predictably.

This comes after long discussions about problems within the family. To give an example, I’ve been told by my stepdad I’m not allowed home, and my mom said that my brother’s abuse was his own fault.
So after she was upset I wouldn’t be coming to Thanksgiving, I wanted to try and explain why... I’m not sure why I keep trying though tbh... haha

Edit: She didn’t respond, by the way.",I have no idea what we’re talking about,"My mom and I used to text nearly every day; a lot of it was either me serving as a therapist or someone to talk to in order to help her, or her trying to tell me what I’m doing wrong and what I should do instead. (She’s very much a characteristic N and of course, her way is the only right way)

So after an incident in late August-a physical encounter between my stepdad and my brother- that was the breaking point for me. He crossed a line, I don’t plan on having any relationship with him unless he made some severe changes and apologies, and went to counseling. Of course I really don’t think he’d ever do that. Why would he? He’s got his own daughter and son anyways, my brother and I (but especially my brother), he could care less about (except that I was expected to replace my dad with him, even though I still saw my dad every other weekend. Side note- a big reason I was able to identify my mom & stepdad’s nbehavior was the normalcy and nurturing I felt when I went to my dad’s, even though he really doesn’t seem super invested in my life either)

Anyways- after the incident, my mom gradually tried more to convince me that my stepdad did absolutely nothing wrong and that my brother deserved it. To which I have VERY strong feelings against (she needs to reevaluate her fucking priorities if she thinks someone deserves to be treated like shit by a parent or anyone else). She even said that kids are supposed to fear their parents. What the fuck?? No, they aren’t. You don’t deserve to be a parent.

So I decided to just stop answering her texts. Of course I’m not going back to visit, and also I’m not allowed back home according to my stepdad, lol. I used to visit maybe twice a month on the weekends.

And so, after texting her most days, I stopped replying, after she asked if everything was okay. She’s told me before that she worries about me if she doesn’t hear back when she asks that. Except that was three weeks ago (I know it’s definitely not long compared to a lot of people’s Nc on here). But, if she really cared, I think she would’ve tried texting me again by now, or maybe, Idk, tried calling?? After contact nearly every day, and now no contact whatsoever, you think she’d care a little bit?

I’m realizing she only wants me on the line so she can vent and tell me how much pain she’s in,  how hard work is, what I’m doing wrong, etc. So much for “worrying” or caring about me.

It’s so obvious because my mother-in-law is a good mom who genuinely cares about my husband, and about me as well. It’s just stunning and a bit heartbreaking when I see her behavior compared to my own mom’s.

TL;DR My mom, who says she cares and who I texted nearly every day, is reacting to three weeks of NC by not even trying to reach me. Which is fine, but I just really see where her priorities lie.
","If we didn’t like his emotionally abusive ways, or disobeyed him in the midst of his rage and childish ways, we could leave.

Well now, I’m grown and have left. I’m married and have taken all my stuff (he’s also the one I wrote about who got arrested for putting hands on my brother). I’m not coming back.

If he wanted to play, “my house My rules, leave if you don’t like it”, then this is how it ends up.
Enjoy your lonely house by yourself, old man.","So my stepdad was always threatening physical violence growing up and using emotional abuse. He would do really awful things, but then do something that he thought (maybe wasn’t necessarily true) was extravagantly nice- not to make up for anything (because of course he’s perfect and me and my brother would be ungrateful to think otherwise, since he worked for the roof over our heads and he was entitled to treat his children like whatever he wanted). So he would try to prove to himself by doing nice things that he wasn’t just a good parent, he was an over-achiever parent.

Anyway he is very hot headed and when he got angry, he would yell and get up in the person’s face. And unfortunately he has a ridiculously powerful voice. He’s also very strong, and he knows it. 

So I was always scared of him growing up. I avoided anything physical by knowing what not to do. He still emotionally abused me, a lot (my mom did too). After leaving for college I began to realize the extent of my issues with self-confidence, self-worth, anxiety, depression, and other things that I had been convinced were my own fault. 

He did the same to my brother, though my brother is maybe a bit of an N too. He constantly fought back against him and my mom, though (verbally). So finally, three days before my brother leaves for college without any intention of coming back (it had been made clear that he was not welcome, and he made it clear he never wanted to come back), my stepdad takes his filthy hands and lays them on my brother. This isn’t the first time- even when he was little it had happened before. My idiot of a stepdad didn’t do it a lot because he knew that there was a chance we’d report him; we were a little too rebellious for that to work (there were two step siblings as well growing up).

So this raging maniac grabbed my brother and threw him into walls, because he ordered him out of HIS house and my brother was grabbing things to leave. But apparently, he was only allowed to grab one shirt- because he’s not entitled to clothes, personal belongings, toiletries, a pillow- no. Because this fucker is a pompous ass who thinks that since he’s been wronged for 15 years by having to raise a bastard of a step son, he can do whatever he’d like. 

So I get a text about all this from my brother after it happened, along with a sound recording of the incident. He had grab marks on his arms and a few bruises. NOBODY was going to do anything. My mom’s mentality was “he shouldn’t have incited the incident”. He went to work and they didn’t really do anything either (BONUS: my mom’s friend, his coworker, told him he should lie to the cops so it wouldn’t end up hurting my mom)

Growing up with this kind of situation instills a lot of ingrown fear, and this fear follows you, even when you’re married and independent. So with other times it had been really hard to stand up to my stepdad. One time my stepdad refused to get physical therapy for my brother, basically because “he wasn’t trying hard enough to heal”. My brother couldn’t fucking straighten his arm (he still can’t fully extend it). The most I was able to say is, “I really think he needs physical therapy”. This overgrown baboon decided to threaten me, saying I needed to stay out of it. I was shaking with fear. That’s as far as I was able to go. 

Back to the original story- maybe because of my efforts to heal and regain self-confidence, and also because of years of this shit happening, and my brother going through this and being kicked out of his own house before age 18, that was the breaking point. I called the cops on him. He got arrested and is being charged with a felony. 

There is so much RELIEF that came from that. Finally, a bit of justice; if this goes through, this idiot won’t be able to get a normal job. He’s going to have a felony on his record forever. My brother has a restraining order processing against him. I’m not going to engage in contact with him anymore, and I know I don’t have to have any guilt about that whatsoever. We exchanged words over text, and it went something like this: 

Me: If you fucking hurt my brother I will call the cops. [By the way to even say something like that was considered high treason against this dictator moron]

Him: Really. Believe me if I wanted to hurt your pos [piece of shit] brother I would have. If you want to get involved with this, that’s fine too. Or else stay the fuck out of it. I have put up with his shit for 15 years and it isn’t going to go on for another god damn day. And if he shows up at my house again I will call the cops.

Me: Fuck you. You fucking bastard.

Him: Ha, you can stay out too.

Me: Why the fuck do you think I got married and took all my stuff?

Him: I don’t care, and you didn’t take all your stuff [threatening]. Go move in with your father. [background: he has a grudge because they couldn’t convince me to disown my father who I saw every other weekend, since my stepdad thought he was a saint for being less than a father to me]...[then some other personal stuff was said]. By the way *brother* is fucking lying if he said I hit him.

Me: I don’t believe you, at all. I’ve seen you hurt him, I’ve seen you go at *step sibling*

Him: Go put your head back up your ass. So now *brother* is so honest? [then more personal info]

Me: I love you and I know that *brother* is an undisciplined ass but I finally have the courage to stand up to you without the threat of violence 🤷‍♀️ [emotional abuse sucks because it’s complicated. There were good times here and there] 

Him: Don’t come back. Thanks for calling the cops, they were very familiar with *brother* due to his shoplifting tickets [lie], hit and run [bg: he hit a car when backing out from a parking spot, slowly; went to inspect it, and saw there were no dings or scratches so he left, but jerk called the cops on him], and suicide threats [wtf? Why do you think he had those? Pays tribute to this fucker’s influence]

Me: You’re welcome. Too bad they never got familiar with you. [by the way we later found out he had a court date that week for a DUI- not his first either]

Him: I’m glad we had this conversation, I now know where you stand

Me: I watched in fear as you threatened or hurt *brother* [did so to stepsibling as well but they did not like being brought into it] and I was not able to do anything. Whether you like it or not, physical abuse is a crime. That’s where I stand. Enough is enough. And you can’t hurt me anymore, that’s for sure.

Him: You don’t know what you’re talking about

The kicker is that since raging moron couldn’t be a decent human for three days until my brother moved to college, now his nine month long job search has been infinitely extended, to top off his already large debt because he can’t control himself. Plus, out of his four...kids... one’s out of town, my brother’s definitely not coming back  and is getting a restraining order, another has other beef with him and now I’m not coming back either. I would previously come visit a couple weekends a month plus holidays. I say this because he’s holed up in the house with few friends and no job. Really, he’s finally going to feel pain and regret for these “fifteen years”. 

There’s so much relief; my brother doesn’t have to be near that situation anymore, and I overcame fear of standing up to him. And yet... I’m strangely sad- partly because of the strange relationship we had, and partly because I won’t get to see my home or my dog for a very long time...

TL;DR After my brother and I had years of emotional abuse and threats, some justice is finally being served against our stepdad because he physically abused my brother and got arrested for it.

itsrin17_,"I feel like I wasted this whole year. In the beginning of the hear I had an emotional break down because of college and decided to take a semester off 3 weeks into the new semester. I took a month off and during that time I had no contact with anyone. May e 1 person bothered to even contact me but they didn't even ask how I was. Then I started working for my aunt and started to feel good actually getting up and doing something. But I have problems with self loathing, anxiety about the future.

I liked being at home and doing nothing but it bothered me that I wasnt doing anything productive.

I cant even tell if I was depressed or not, but either way I was and am pretty upset.

geminifairy,"I have a long history with depression, anxiety, and binge eating. I've been in therapy most of my life and I wish I could say it's helped more - I'm definitely more self-aware and emotionally intelligent than I would be without, though. 

I had grief therapy after losing my dad and grandparents at a young age, and kept seeing a therapist as I got older due to anxiety, depression, and some bullying in school. I saw a psychiatrist on and off in my tween years who put me on different medications, most of which didn't help. It wasn't until I was 15 or so that I was in a residential treatment facility and was prescribed Wellbutrin and Lexapro and given DBT skills that I started to get a bit better. However, my mom and I were constantly fighting and there was a lot of family trauma she and my twin brother just weren't dealing with, and eventually it was just emotionally abusive and I was put into foster care from 16-18. Luckily, I went to a small alternative school that gave me a sense of stability through moving at least six times in those two years.

I live on my own now in a studio apartment through a transitional living program for ex foster youth, and I'm the heaviest I've ever been, and my depression/anxiety is definitely there. I'm on Effexor and Abilify and they mostly just numb me out. I experimented with drugs, mainly psychedelics, the last couple years and I wonder if that's had an effect on me, but I just don't feel okay. I feel defeated by life. I work on the weekends and am in school, but can barely do those things - only a year ago I was in and out of the hospital for suicidal ideation, and so I've made a lot of progress, but it's hard to live life normally especially in this pandemic. Cleaning/completely essential tasks is a challenge. I'm confused about my purpose in life and often question why I'm here. I'll feel depressed but don't cry, I don't experience emotions intensely like I used to - which is probably a good thing, but I wish I could just be sad for awhile and then move on instead of this constant depressed/numb feeling.

I have the possibility of getting weightloss surgery, I'm about 300lbs right now, but they want me to work on my binge eating first but I don't even know where to start with that. I don't know how to cook and eating junk is my main coping skill, although I do know DBT skills, I've been binge eating since I was 7 and it's hard to let go of that habit that brings me comfort. I will have to move out of this program at the end of next year and I'm scared to live with roommates because I don't want anyone to see how I struggle with things like cleaning and staying on top of things. I honestly can't think this far ahead without some sort of suicidal thought coming up (I'm not in danger of attempting, I just struggle with ideation sometimes). 

Anyways, I don't really know what the point of writing this was - I just wanted to get this all out and maybe someone out there relates to what I'm going through and can offer hope/advice.

Thanks for reading🪐","First post here. Thanks for letting me vent...

I’ve had binge eating disorder since I was 7. I’m 20 now and I’m so tired. I doordash more food than I need whenever I have the money. I’m trying to spend money on other things , I do compulsively spend but I feel better buying things other than food. But it’s so hard not to. 

I had a lot of deaths in the family and was bullied as a kid, and my mom and I started fighting all the time in my teens which eventually led to me going into foster care at 16. Now I live on my own. I’ve binged throughout to manage my feelings but now that I live alone and buy my own groceries I’ve gained a lot of weight, currently 300lbs. I have an opportunity to get bariatric surgery however they want me to work on my binge eating first and I honestly don’t know if I can do it. Food is my biggest comfort.

I just need a friend ..",Oh wow I never thought of it like that .. you might be right . I’ve heard that startling them can scare them so that’s exactly what could of happened .,See that’s the weird thing we picked him up Sunday cause I usually give him about a few days to digest and he was fine .. went outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather and today he’s just not having it . Might just be a bad day for him !,My ball python is about 6 months old and he’s usually very docile and hasn’t bit or striked at us yet . I got home and tried to handle abs weigh my snake and noticed that once I took his hide off he he completely was in a “s “ shape and was standing straight up following my hands from the top of the tank. Decided it would be wise to let him be but does  anyone know if this means my ball python is stressed or just hungry ? He ate Friday and it’s now Tuesday.. never has had this type of demeanor before . Thank you for your guys advice in advance !  And also he didn’t strike at us .. he was in the air and then just went back down into his little corner still looking defensive,Motivation is hard ! It really is! Sometimes it’s hard to find that motivation but you just have to remember your “WHY” and remind your self you didn’t come this far to only come this far ! 2 weeks binge free is amazing!🥳 seriously the journey is a tough one with so many obstacles but you got this !

Good luck and well wishes to you all!🤍,"So Not really sure what I’m writing about but I guess I just wanted a ear to listen . I’ve been struggling with my weight my entire life . And sadly it went from overeating , to anorexia , to now binge eating . I feel so lost and out of touch and just not in control of my life anymore . I know so many on here can relate that binge eating really is a “escape “ . It’s like that one little pleasure that no matter the guiltiness we’ll experience later it’s about living in the now. Tonight I binged on Burger King and chocolate cake and tried to purged (unsuccessfully) I feel so embarrassed and sad and just alone . I just want to say hi to everyone in this community  because for once I feel like I could connect with people who understand the struggle and maybe for once i won’t feel alone ❤️",Thank you so much for the  advice !,Yes I have a block of the coco Fibre so maybe I’ll give that a shot !

And I know how could I really know he hates it lol usually when I put him down on the Aspen he slithers to his bowl or one of his hides and he just seemed super confused . Maybe he just has to get use to it .,"Hey guys! Just a quick question on substrate! So recently I got a new ball python and he was using Aspen bedding which came with him from the reptile store .. he ended up getting wood mites assuming from the aspen bedding and we cleaned his entire cage and hides , ect THOROUGHLY and himself just to be sure . Everything looks okay but now he’s using coco husk (the chips) and we ended up baking them to kill off any potential mites... my snake HATES IT! he is only a month and half old and I was wondering if anyone had ANY suggestions on what substrate I could use instead of the coco husk ? He is small so I’m not sure if the chips are to hard and uncomfortable on him ? Thank you guys in advance !"

I'm sorry your answer is so long and I don't have anything else to say. I read it all and understood it. Thank you for your input.","Love bombing is often talked about in the context of narcissistic people in relashionship. 

But I guess it could apply to other Cluster B disorders. I know people with BPD often want to stop being like that unlike other Cluster B personality disorders. Not to invalidate your experience I just pity them. :(","I was thinking more, if someone believes all men are either doormats or abusers, she is more likely to be okay with doormats or abusers. Or as you say ignore all of those she classify in those groups aka all men.

I think I do have some amount of self-respect. I am very respectful of others but I also know when to prioritize myself. I also don't have a religious upbringing. 
I do place value on my virginity even if I'm not religious. But not because I think being ""pure"" is better. I'm a very sensible person, I don't know, I just want my first time to be with someone who cares. But I guess it does make me have this mindset ""I can't make a wrong choice"". And honestly I am not willing to change that mindset.

I only have this b/w thinking with men who I perceive as potential partners, or simply attractive. 

I also think most people give trust to people who do things for them, and when people do things for me I recieve it but I don't necessarly trust the person. I trust people for other reasons like when things don't go their way are they still willing to prioritize me sometimes? Anyway I think people get their ego offended when I don't trust them immediately. And that could play a role. I percieve sex as something ""men want to get from me"" and therefore I don't trust them immediately.

Are you talking about the law of attraction here?","""First of all, you don’t have to feel embarrassed about posting this. It seems like a relatively normal thing to wonder about to me."" Thanks :)

""Yes, he is a man, but his first classification is a person. It would be the same way you chat and are friendly with other women or platonic relations"" I agree that the way we talk to both gender shouldn't be different. The thing is I rarely found boys trying to be friend with me for the sake of being friends. Unless we're like in a group of friends. Also I feel like men are less receptive than women when I talk to them randomly.","""This is not uncommon."" I'm happy to hear that.

""classify men as either doormats or players/abusers"" Yeah I do that, I have a really bad view of men. 

""doesn't mean that they will tolerate being treated like a doormat"" Do I treat them like doormats? How?

I may try being more open to the idea that men have good intentions when talking to me.
And since this is a projection, it means in order to trust men, I have to trust myself and allow myself to make mistakes. Is that good?

But I also feel like this is not only a projection. This bad view of men. This is something I had in my head since I was a child. I think it's an universal experience for women. I started puberty really young. And my mother let me watch TV a lot, and I think media around 2005 weren't really giving the message that men could care about women for anything else than their sexual value.

Thank you for your comment btw it sounds smart and I appreciate","I'm a 21F virgin. I don't have a good social life since maybe ugh, 3 or 4 years. I want to work on that but there's the virus.

I only had 1 girlfriend for 2 months in my teen years and a weird friend/flirting relashionship with a sociopath after that. I used to be very shy and avoid men I was attracted to at all cost. I had social anxiety and I was scared I would overreact if I talked to them (shaking, crying). And the shaking did happen so I just wanted to hide. I had such low self-esteem.

I also had this conception that men only want sex and aren't mature enough in their teen for what a relashionship entails. I think my big brother has a sexist (incel maybe) view of women and it may have impacted me. I feel like men view women through their perception of what a woman is instead of simply human being. For that reason when a man is really sexy and attractive to me I tend to assume he's a player or a bad guy. And I don't know what behavior I am supposed to go along with or not? I don't know what normal men are like when flirting. 

And I'm kinda desperate, I had times when I'm like an incel and I'm talking to a man and I'm like ""how can I have a relashionship with him"" even if I'm not particularly attracted to him. When I think about past times when men have flirted with me I remember I wasn't attracted to the dude at first but they were kinda pushy like players. I don't trust my ability to identify what men are good for me. My ex girlfriend was manipulative too, and I know it probably comes from my mother who was manipulative..

You wonder if she's manipulating you. Maybe? I don't know. Keep all the possibilities in mind. But don't tell her that. Telling a rape victim that they're saying that just for attention is very harmful and adds to the trauma. I think it's better to assume it's true than to ignore and risk allowing an abusive situation to continue.

My thought is, if she got raped repeatedly, she could be used to the situation. I don't know if you know about the term ""learned helplessness"". Maybe she doesn't have the willpower to get out of this situation.

Rape victims tend to feel ashamed and disgusting after. Maybe that's why she sent the beach picture. Some rape victim become very sexual in order to regain a sense of control over their sexuality. But she could be doing this manipulatively. It's weird that she told you right after you rejected her. Maybe she's testing you to see your limits? Or not?
It's also possible she got raped for real but just not in the current moment, maybe one time and she's trying to get attention for that, we never know! Traumatize people have PTSD syndrome, but for her it will be C-PTSD because it happened over time, so you can know if she has been raped for real by looking for the symptoms, the shame or things like that.

Most of us think we would fight or run, however, in reality, such assaults are known to induce extreme survival reactions like physical freezing and being unable to scream for help or say words, for example ""stop."" Another extreme survival response can be passing out. These responses are involuntary and are a normal byproduct of terror.

throwawayyyy191,"I 'm so lonely it's driving me insane. I'm sure many people feel like this at a point in their lives, so honestly I don't know if I belong in this sub, but everyday for the whole of this year had been pretty much devoid of happiness. After I graduated from pre-university, I just lost 95% of my friends. And I had ALOT of friends there, I'd say more than the average person. Maybe amplified by the effects of the pandemic but everyone seemed to move on to their own paths in life after graduation and I have not seen or talked to them in a long while. I understand that people come and go, but having so little of them actually stick is making me wonder if there is something I did wrong or differently. I don't wish to call myself depressed since that would be undermining the pain felt by many others in this sub, but I wake up everyday simply devoid of happiness. I am attending university now and just completed my first semester. Number of friends I've made? Zero. Granted due to covid I only went to the school campus twice the whole semester. The next semester is going to be physical classes so I feel a bit hopeful, but then I think of all the hi-bye friends I made in pre-U and wonder what is the point of all of this? The worst part is that I used to be happy, to have people that I could count on, to have friends I could hang out with often. The contrast to my life today is making me feel empty and worthless. I know people out there have more important things to worry about, such as getting enough food or a shelter over their heads but ... i just feel sad. 

I just wish I can look back at this post in maybe a year and go like ""oh what was going on with me back then, thank god I found my purpose in life ! Life is good today.""

The program then prints if the triangle is valid/invalid. A triangle is valid if the sum of its two sides is greater than the third side.

This is the code I have written:

 

\#include <stdio.h>  
int main(void) {  
 int a;  
 int b;  
 int c;  
 printf(""Enter side:"");  
 scanf(""%d"", &a);

 printf(""Enter side:"");  
 scanf(""%d"", &c);  
 if (a + b > c || a + c > b || b + c > a) {  
 printf(""Triangle is valid\\n"");  
}  
 else {  
 printf(""Triangle is invalid\\n"");  
}  
}

Problem i'm facing is it keeps giving me valid even if it's invalid. I've tried to make an if else statement for each of the 3 conditions but same problem. How do I solve this?

&#x200B;","Hi everyone, i'm facing some difficulty with the last question of my homework. 

I managed to figure out how to print the sum of the digits, but I am unsure how to specifically prompt the user for a 5 digit number other than just doing printf(""Enter 5 digit number"").

Is there a way where the code ONLY accepts a certain digit integer? In this case, I would like 5 digits only and preferably reject the integer given by the user if it is anything other than that. Thanks.

marenika,"Hi everyone. I need some advice on how to keep a positive mindset during college and how to feel happy and not depressed. I am in my first year in college and I study economics. The last two weeks have been nothig but absolute hell. I constantly feel tired, I am sad everyday for absolutely no reason, I have constant fears and anxiety and college has basically just started. I am overwhelmed with all my asignments, studying and tasks. I actually don't know how, at what time and for how long to study because I don't have any working habits and routine because I went to a high school that requires a higher education and you are basically nothing after this school because it's grammar school (I am from a different country so I don't know of you guys have that) and we didn't do anything there, I basically studied for 2 hours the whole week. So you can imagine ehy I am lazy and don't know how to get work done. Ans because of that I am in constant fear that I will fail at everything because I don't study. I am an ambitious person and I would like to graduate and everything. I just lose hope really quickly and even if I fail a single little asignment or test I break down and I have no motivation in continuing. I also feel guilt when I don't study but also can't force myself to grab notes and get any work done. I have been crying all day long and have been overthinking every single thing and it's stopping me from everyday life and activities. I fill my head with nonsense and deal with unnecessary things and think in advance about failure and have negative thoughts before I even write an exam. I often have panic attacks, I feel nervous and I even think I have anxiety even though I don't like to self diagnose and think about that. I also don't know how to study and I procrasinate and leave everything for the last minute and everyone who goes to college probably knows that college requires a lot of studying and there is a lot of study material for just one stupid test. I have been reading about college depression and I believe it is a real thing. Also this whole coronavirus situation contributes to this whole messy situations because I just stare at my screen for way too long, I didn't make any new friends, I can't get help from anyone if I am stuck with courses and I have no human contact. I also have thoughts now that I never had before. 

I hope I didn't bore anyone with this because I am really struggling and don't know how to deal with emotions and I don't know how to get myself to study and actually get any damn work done.

I just really need some help and advice and someone to talk to because I don't know how to deal with this by myself and just want a clear head with no worries. I want some support because I don't have anyone to talk to about how to study and how to get my college life together.","Svjesna sam ih, samo što se s tim ne znam na koji način nositi i stvara mi to onda dosta problema

Ništa nije teško, moraš si samo zadati cilj. Meni je samo problem da ne mogu naći volju i teško mi je sve pohvatati i imam osjećam da se doslovno pre natrpam s poslom i niš na kraju ne stignem i ne ispadne kak ja hoću, pa se zato i vjerojatno osjećam tak kak se osjećam. Izgubim nadu jednostavno","Da voljela bih stvarno završiti faks, jer sam stvarno ambiciozna i imam puno ideja za sebe i svoj život, ali jednostavno zbog nekvog straha i panike i previše razmišljanja se ne mogu prisiliti i razmišljam stalno i razbijam glavu glupostima. Nisam navikla s nikim razgovarati o nečemu takvome, pogotovo sa starcima jer znam da me ne bi shvatili ozbiljno. I pogotovo sad na faksu nemam nekog ko bi mi pomogao ako zapnem ili ako imam kakvo pitanje, a profesori se čine dosta nepristupačni.

Trebala bi neki savjet ili dva kako se nositi s fakultetom i općenito kako izdržati i imati neki pozitivan mindset. Naime, studiram ekonomiju i prva sam godina tek, a meni se već sve raspada. Znam da je još rano i neki će misliti šta je ovoj, nisu prošla ni tri mjeseca. Moj problem je što sam na faksu eto tako bezveze. Završila sam jezičnu gimnaziju i to eto dijelom jer me je stari nagovorio, a dijelom jer sam bila neupućena i nisam znala što bih sa sobom pa eto tako završila u gimni. Nemam uopće radne navike jer u srednjoj nismo uopće radili, zezali se, nismo usmeno odgovarali, prepisivali i mislim da nisam učila doslovce ni tri puna sata na tjedan i četiri godine sam potrošila uzaludno. Još uvijek žalim za danom kad sam mogla upisati za kozmetičara i završiti uz to tečaj za vizažista jer se mogu u tome vidjeti i imati vlastiti obrt. Nije da nisam ambiciozna, jesam, i to poprilično te se mogu vidjeti u tome što studiram, ali moj problem je jednostavno što ne znam kako i kada učiti, nemam dovoljno koncentracije, sve mi je zanimljivo osim knjige, ali uz to imam strah od neuspjeha i hvata me panika ako nešto ne položim i paničarim jer sve ostavim za zadnji tren i jednostavno se osjećam kao da ću se psihički raspasti. Ne mogu otići ni na kavu ni kod tate ili bilo kamo, a da ne razmišljam o faksu i većinu vremena sam žalosna. Uz sve to, kod kuće imam poprilične obiteljske probleme koji mi stvaraju dodatnan pritisak i svakodnevno se nosim s time. Osjećam se psihički izmoreno i zadnjih par tjedana samo ležim, za ništa me nije briga, doživljavam živčane slomove i doslovce ko da će mi se tijelo ugasiti. Zanima me ima li netko od vas koji je u sličnoj situaciji ili je bio, a da zna kako se nositi s time?","Ne znam hoće li itko ovo još čitati, nova sam na redditu pa... Uglavnom dolazim iz Međimurja i išla sam tu i u gimnaziju. Kratko rečeno, za mene totalni promašaj. S jedne strane bila sam sama nabrijana za tu školu, ali s jedne strane me nagovorio stari. Mama mi je uvijek govorila da ne idem u gimnaziju jer nemam radne navike i dobre ocjene iz osnovne. Nisam ju slušala i mislila sam si pa s toliko bodova iz osnovne moram upisati gimnaziju, bila bi šteta da idem nešto drugo ili ne daj Bože trogodišnja srednja. Nisam imala pojma šta radim i gimna mi je bila gubitak vremena jer nismo ništa radili i svi prof su popuštali. I sad gubim živce, mučim se s stresom i depresijom i općenito mi ne ide na faksu jer nemam kao prvo nikakve radne navike i navikla sam na srednju gdje nismo uopće usmeno odgovarali, nismo se mučili za ispite sve prepisali, shvaćali olako i učila sam doslovce 3h na tjedan, ako i to. Jako sam lazy, ali sam jako ambiciozna i voljela bi završiti faks i raditi u smjeru za koji studiram. Uglavnom, long story short žalim za danom kada nisam upisala srednju za kozmetičara ili barem frizerku jer vidim sebe u toj grani i sa svojim vlastitim obrtom."

breaktheicejjfish,"I always had depression but now it’s bad enough to take effect on me physically. I do not believe in treating it because there is no permanent solution. I will only feel somewhat ok while the pill is doing it’s thing. 
I used to have long blonde hair. I used to be fit and go to gym 5 days a week. I used to have eyelash and nail extensions. I used to do makeup and get new trendy clothes all the time. Go to a spa for moisturising treatments. Get compliments all the time. 
Now I look in a mirror and can’t help but think ‘what happened’. 
It all started once we all went into a nation wide lockdown and I decided to move out of the city and get a full time job. Previously I was dependant financially on my partner. Hence why I was able to keep up the good looks. But I wanted to become independent, at least financially because while being under someone else’s wing, I felt as unsafe as ever. I am happy with the new gained financial independence and the ability to be my own person but I don’t like the effects it has taken on me both physically and financially. 
It all started with all my hair falling out. It was gradual but now I can’t wear it down because there are 5 hairs on my head. I stopped getting it bleached completely but that hasn’t done anything for thickness. I will get it cut super short once hair salons are open and not bleach it to save the few hairs I have left. 
I gained a lot of weight. In the beginning I did hit the gym, after work, 3-4 days a week but it didn’t do much because I use food as a way to cope with depression. It’s a big part of pleasure and excitement I have in my life at this current state. I tried counting calories but I get very depressed if I’m low on carbs. I need to get checked for diabetes but I am scared to go to the hospital due to corona virus outbreak. Not scared for myself but for other people around me.
I have no motivation to workout as I am not going on any holidays and not seeing anyone soon so I just eat. 
Also, I am dealing with a never ending bloating. It’s there if I drink a cup of tea or have 1 apple. 
I also dislike my job and have no energy to do anything after it. I can’t stand the lack of presence and attention from my partner but I am too scared to leave him. I’m scared it will be a big mistake. I’m most of all angry at myself for being depressed for such frivolous things while there are way worse things happening.
There are so many issues to address here, but the main one is my lack of motivation to change my current physical state. People do not recognise me any longer.","First of all, you’re a real man for not ghosting her which pretty much makes you a diamond in a field of rocks. Men (and some women, myself in the last as well) these days are scared little creatures who can’t face telling a woman something that will make them feel uncomfortable. Second of all, you deserve more than ‘someone good enough to settle for it no ones better comes around’. You deserve to be the first and only choice. I’m sure there are women who will feel passion and warmth towards you in the very beginning.","Not sure if this will make you feel better but I am a female version of you. Chubby, my hair is falling so I will probably shave it. I tried hitting the gym and eating healthy but my issue is I turn to food for comfort and get really hungry when I eat low calorie. You are not alone so don’t feel like you are. Try and stick to a healthy diet and hit the gym. Work hard, make money, be kind and just don’t overthink things. You don’t know what exactly turned her off. Maybe you look like the guy who cheated on her. Don’t let insecurities take over your life as we only have 1 life.",Yes I agree! Your experience sounds great. I am in UK,I had a herniated disc and walked into an emergency section at a public hospital and waited maybe 6 hours until a doctor took a look at my back and said I should be fine and to take pain killers. I thought great and a few weeks later I am in pain again and can’t stand up straight so I try my luck at another hospital. After waiting for around 6 hours I was taken in by a nurse who seemed concerned about me but said she’s not qualified and I should go see a doctor at a ‘great’ hospital instead. That ‘great’ hospital was the one I first went into. Only until I paid for an appointment and a scan I was thoroughly checked and found out I have this serous injury.,Which country is your gf from? This is really nice,Well yes but the lines to get an appointment with a doctor here are long enough for you to get desperate enough to book a private and paid appointment,Reminds me of the Pewdiepie’s video I watch everyday as a ritual,"Right before Corona Virus hit the world, I had bought a package at a laser clinic in London - 2 Fractional laser appointments for the price of £350. 
Then I had to cancel as I felt sick and right after that corona hit the world and we went into a nation wide lockdown and the clinic obviously had to shut down. Now since this fractional laser package expires in 12 months time, I asked the clinic to extend it and they extended it for further 4 months. Now I had my appointment booked for the 1st treatment on 3rd December but we are in lockdown again until 5th December and the clinic most likely will be closed until then. I sent an email to them 2 weeks ago asking if my appointment is cancelled and if they could reschedule me for the 6th December if it is indeed cancelled but they didn’t reply. I sent another email a week ago but still no reply. I know the owner of the clinic and his assistant are reading emails and are always on social media. Is there any possibility for me to have this £350 back? If they will refuse to reschedule or extend the time of my package? I am tight on money and the only reason I spent this amount on Beauty treatments is because I have very bad acne scarring. Could anybody advise? If the clinic is obligated to refund me? And what if they bankrupt? I received no terms and conditions except for what was written in the offer which was sent to me as an automatic text message. Also both of these treatments must be done 2 months apart and the recovery time is 1 week.",I can’t stand people like that. Why are you speaking on behalf of others?

They must know this so they could help her. You are not her therapist and deserve to be able to heal from this breakup in a way that’s best for you as long as it’s not harming anyone. And no contact is a brilliant way to find the new perspective. She can not have the cake and it eat it too. Break up with you but have you as emotional support when she’s lonely. But trust me, contacting her family and friends if you’re concerned she might do something is the best course of action",This is so well said,"But because they’re kids, no responsibility for torturing an animal will be held. There should be a jail for young kids and parents who allow things like this to happen. And it should be a long sentence.",Or just don’t blast your awful music in public.

But to ridicule you like this? Not right. Does this happen often with other aspects in your life?
Also an edit - it’s completely natural and normal for you as a grown woman wanting to do something spontaneous and exciting!","Fair enough. I definitely can’t speak for every woman. But from speaking with my female friends, I understood that 90% of men on dating websites use puns to start a conversation and it’s not original anymore. Also, could be because we are all in mid twenties, - not super young, we subconsciously seek something more serious that could lead to a long term relationship and a pun could throw some women off. Only in the beginning though, a good sense of humour is a super attractive trait as long as it’s good and not creepy","Ya’ll put some effort into these puns while a simple ‘Hello, how is your day? You look fantastic’ would be x100 more effective. That’s coming from a female. Just a thought, I like the puns just not in the dating environment","Ok, we have a 2nd lockdown of 4 weeks. Then those 4 weeks pass and we will go back to square one. The 3 months lockdown we previously had didn’t save the nation. I will be surprised if this 4 weeks lockdown will not be extended. All this will do is lock people up, get them angry and depressed until they start to rebel and cause more trouble in the end. My heart truly goes for those affected by Covid. But there must be a better solution.","If this happened that means the BLM movement still did not make enough of a difference and inequality, cruelty and hate from those who are meant to protect us are still as prominent as could be. Sick and twisted. Makes me so angry.","I am based in U.K. According to the contract, notice period to the employer is 1.5 months! Employer’s notice to me is 1 month so even if I quick now, they’ll use me up until Christmas","The company I work at is currently understaffed because everybody is quitting the job as the managers keep piling and the piling the work on you until you can’t take no more.
Our director made a statement today basically word to word saying ‘we are super busy and we work from home so the time we would normally spend commuting from work to home, I ask you to spend working additional 40 min.’ With no pay. No additional pay. Free labour. 
How is that legal? I feel like taking a screen shot of this statement and showing to everybody. This is not right. 
I wish I could quit but if I do then I lose my income which is unfortunately needed to survive. 
I feel so done and angry and feel like lashing out at any minute.","Just because someone apologised it does NOT mean you have to accept the apology. If someone hit you in the face and then genuinely apologised, does that mean you would just have to accept it and move on? No. 
I do however think that Trisha was in the wrong here and was cruel and unprofessional towards Ethan as he didn’t say anything that offensive to begin with.","Yesterday I was crushed but now I am just very angry. There is still guy I work with, he was promoted to senior advisor. I have been employed here for 4-5 months now. He always picks on me whatever I do. I make a human error mistake to which I admit but yet he still brings it up to my managers to show what a great attention to detail he has and what a knowledgeable employee he is. He wants to be promoted and earn more as he admitted himself before and does everything he can to have that happen. No matter who he hurts. He’s made mistakes before and gave me bad advice but I always made it a point to inform him in private because those problems didn’t need any escalation to the management and would only embarrass him. My probationary period is 6 months and if he continues to keep criticising me to the manager I will not pass it. It’s gotten way worse ever since I started doing more volume work which received high ratings from our customers. His work receives 1-2 starts while mine receives 4-5. Because I take my time to address all the customer’s needs and he instead chooses to do as much work as possible but half asses it. Yesterday he ratted me out to a manager because he was listening to my phone call and heard me say ‘I am sorry you feel this way, I am not happy about this situation either but we are unable to do anything to change it’ and twisted my words saying that I bad mouthed our company which is not true. I should not have said that I am unhappy about the situation, I admit, but why not tell me in private. Why twist my words? My manager doesn’t speak our language and it’s only 2 of us who do so there’s no one else to clarify - it’s my word against his. He always transfers me the most difficult cases to deal with hiding behind ‘I am a senior advisor, I hate so much to do could you help’. If he can’t do something, he won’t admit to our manager and instead asks me to do it and if I don’t agree, - it’s me who’s the bad guy. I am so disgusted by this person and how much he tries to bring himself up by bringing me down to show what a great worker he is compared to me. 
I just wish I had the financial freedom to quit and give my two cents about him to the management team. But I’d hate to quit because of a ratty snake. But I also feel like because of all the damage he’s done to me (I don’t know what’s being talked behind my back) I don’t see myself every growing in this company. He got what he wanted - made sure he’s the only one who ever gets promoted without any competition.
How do I cope? How do I not let anger get the best of me and tell to his face what a backstabber he is?","Yesterday I just moved into a new apartment and once I opened the doors of the fridge - loads of ants and brown cockroaches appeared. They’re everywhere - in every kitchen/living room cupboard, in bathrooms - some some crawling on toilet paper roll, on the bedroom carpet, found a few cockroaches on the bed frame. Kitchen cabinets are full of bug faeces. 
There are other bugs as well crawling on the floors and walls. 
I am devastated. And disgusted. I could not sleep all night. How could this infestation happen and then get this bad? 
Today is Saturday and my letting agency opens on Monday. I guess I will just have to deal with this throughout the weekend.. what are my rights?
I see no other way rather than having a pest control specialist come in and a cleaner to clean all the cupboards because there are many places to clean and it’s hours worth of work to do. 
I can’t believe this.. an apartment that looked so nice and clean on the outside is a disgusting mess that’s been hidden from me by the letting agency. Had they told me they have insect issues, I’d not have moved in here.
Are my clothes, bags and shoes safe from cockroaches and ants? I suppose keeping any food in here is unsafe? There are bugs and cockroaches crawling on cutlery. On food.
I am so devastated. This is not a cheap apartment and it’s located in a nice are and neighbours seem to be normal. The building is relatively new. I am so scared and just feel down and blame myself for moving out.
Should I put peppermint essential oil in cupboards?","I had my braces removed 2 weeks ago. 
I loved having Damon Clear! Though keep in mind they won’t be that clear (or should I say invisible). When I first got them on, I was surprised how bulky the clear brackets were and the wire was metal but in actuality they’re way more aesthetically nice looking than fully metal ones. 
They didn’t cause me much trouble considering I had to fly many miles to have them adjusted. 
I recommend them.","Because I have bad internet connection.
I started a new job 2.5 months ago. I really like it. I had some issues with a manger but those were resolved. A new issue arose however - my apartment started to have an awful renovating process a week ago and ever since then my internet connection is 1-2mbps download speed. My work requires making many phone calls all to another country. And because of my slow internet I end up not being able to hear anyone on the phone as the signal is so bad.
I’m so scared I’ll get fired. I contacted my internet operator and they said it should work fine but it’s not. How can my job keep me if I can’t even do an important task. 
I was renting Airbnb room for a few days and it was great having stable internet connection, I was able to be so productive. But I can’t afford to keep on renting rooms as in where I live they’re very expensive. 
I am going to move out of my current apartment as soon as possible. But what can I do for now. Setting up a new broadband would take 3 weeks. How do I do explain to the management what I’m experiencing and not get fired for not being able to provide myself with essentials of the job I do. This job is all I have and I really like it.
I cry everyday because of the distress that this lack of internet is causing me. As I can’t do my job properly not because I’m incompetent, but because I do not have the right environment.."

alicemayhz,"TW // self harm, suicidal ideation

I had intense moment with my clinical psychologist today after I told her I still self harm and been researching about suicide. She said she want to talk to my parents and I immediately refused. My parents  know I'm seeing psychologist but I just told them its because I'm stressed out. I never tell anyone else I struggle with self harm and depression, and its been about 3 years now. I tried opening up to my parents, but they will never understand. They will tell this to my other relatives. They will ask me questions and make me feel worst about myself. I don't talk about it to my friends either because I don't want to be pitied. No one knows. I tried opening up to my other trusted friends, but that trusted ended up betraying me by emotionally hurting me ever again.

I am referred to psychiatrist for medication. I told my parents its because of my headache. I just want to tell someone about this. I want to tell it to someone I personally know and not online.

So my research was about whether attention & modality (visual and auditory) can affect false recall (one hypothesis is divided attention will have more falsely recalled words than full attention). I already did the analysis for that, but my lecturer also wanted me to ask participant's preferred modality when learning ; whether they prefer learning through visual (study on notes) or auditory (listening to podcast).

brett199720,"Hi everyone, I’m new here :)

When I feel down, anxious or angry at myself, I always say things ‘out loud’ and by that I mean I just whisper them to myself or shout them depending if I’m alone or living with people. For example, when I’m feeling a bit low and want to cry, I’ll angrily whisper ‘you’re weak’, or something along those lines, to myself.

Anyway the point of that was to ask if any of you whisper or say things out loud to yourself when you’re not at your best or is it all just internally? 

Thank you","I understand that, I’m the same. When I get anxious, I always come across as really irritated and short tempered. It’s something that just happens, it’s probably our body’s way of protecting us or something? No idea though, all I know is that it is annoying.","This has happened constantly for the past few months, even when I was on iOS 13. No idea why it hasn’t been fixed yet despite sending many bug reports","Literally this happened to me for so many of the betas on Big Sur!

History always repeats itself I guess?","Yep, that’s a common situation for me as well. Some days I just do not believe in myself or have enough energy to face my anxieties but other days I do. However, on the days I don’t face up to anxiety, I do feel like I’ve let myself down a little bit too!

In saying that, going and doing something that causes you anxiety is a huge step so it’s totally okay that you don’t want to do it every time because it is so exhausting.

I am not sure why I’m socially anxious, I was always shy as a child/early teen and at some point during my late teen years, I developed social anxiety (maybe it had something to do with depression as I also developed that during my mid-late teen years).

I only usually think about it when I have to go out and do something like shopping, a walk, meeting people, etc

I would say it somewhat affects my relationships with friends in that I tend to people please to avoid any conflicts.

As a gay guy, speaking to the other gender is one of the easier things I can do, speaking to ‘straight lads’ is something I can rarely do due to fear of judgement and I begin to act up trying to fit into the ‘straight’ stereotype. (That could be part of my internalised homophobia, but who knows!)

I don’t really hate it when people talk to me, in fact depending on the situation I like if! As I’m awful at starting conversation so someone else starting it is a weight off of my shoulder tbh!

I have been through therapy once before to help social anxiety, I’ve tried medication as well but currently I am in the middle of another set of counselling sessions for it! And nope, I am definitely not happy with how I am.

It was boring as shit. But that's why I liked it. Just sat around until someone came in looking for phones and just talk to people, get to know them and their needs and recommend a phone and plan.

I eventually got burned out and I just ghosted the big. Just stopped showing up and answering my boss's calls. The new boss was a giant asshole  that took over a few months before I quit. So that was a major factor.

I'm now making twice as much for way less work as an on call sys admin. I literally just lay in bed all day most days and watch TV until something goes wrong or until code needs to be updated. So I've actually gotten more depressed. But I like that I can live on my own with no support. Last year, I was kinda forced to live with my mom. And now that I'm 30, I'm too old for that.

Anyways, I keep having dreams where I am working my kms job. And each dream tho. I'm not getting any sales. Just standing around my store and sucking at sales like I did before quitting. But for some reason, in my dream, I'm somewhat happy there. 

But I wouldn't go back. I do not want to be a broke lowley wireless sales rep.

But why do these dreams keep occurring? I quit in June of 2019."

When I was 13 I made the decision to live with my Dad and stepmother (will be referred to as mom from this point on). My sister didn't move with me and my mother demanded more child support and less time with me and more time with my sister. I wasn't allowed in her home without her there and, despite the legal documents was really only allowed to come over on holidays. Also, she always took money from me during holidays. Anyway... after that point our relationship was good then bad, off and on for years. When I was 23  I got married to my wife and my mother made a scene at our wedding which lead to us not speaking for a year. I got stationed oversees and the relationship was... okay I guess. We welcomed our first child. Fast forward to 27 and I decide to do an at home DNA test. My dad wasn't showing as related to me. Obviously a massive blow to me in evert way. I felt like I lost my identity, who I was, where I belonged, my whole life was a lie. When I confronted her over text she denied denied denied ( she was a product of the same situation and found out at 27 too). I begged her to give me any info. She wouldn't, I asked her to please do it for my daughter, she wouldn't. We haven't spoken since. She is a nasty nasty toxic person. That was the first MAJOR blow to my mental health

Shortly afterward my married took a hit. I was caught talking to guys online and my wife found out. My indiscretions led to a crumbling marriage and was pushed to come out as bisexual. I still haven't accepted this for myself and don't know when I will. We have been working on things for over a year now since I was caught being unfaithful and my wife reminds me frequently of what I did and how much it hurt and hiw she wishes I feel the same pain. We got stationed to a new base overseas. 

Second MAJOR blow to my mental health

Earlier this year I was able to find my biological father after searching and searching with no help or info due to my mother's lack of transparency. He is actually awesome although I havent met him in person. Obviously my Dad took all of this news about this DNA test extremely hard and doesn't speak of it, but I feel like we have grown closer. He will always be my dad. 

The day I called my dad to tell him I found my biological father he stopped me and told me he had cancer. How could this be? I feel like we are closer and have so much more to do, so muxh more bonding. Over this past year he has steadily declined in health and now has a 20% of living. I havent seen my dad for more than a week in 4 years. My dad is dying and is crushes me. We decided to put in for a humanitarian move back to my hometown which has a base for me. It isn't approved yet but will allow me to be with my father for as long as he has left. I cry about this so much. 

Third MAJOR hit to my mental health. 

I decided I am going to better myself and get some help so i went to the mental health clinic to address my depression and anxiety. I am in therapy now and on meds but I don't feel like anything is working. I have lost most motivation to do anything, no energy, no joy (other than being a father which is the best thing to ever happen to me). I've gained like 20 pounds and just don't care anymore. My new base sucks, I hate work. I dont have any friends, marriage is still rocky, I cant stop thinking about the biological father thing, my relationship with my mother, my indiscretions, and my dad dying. 

I just want it all to go away. To pause. I want to be happy again. I wish I made better choices","Oh I'm alright man, im taking care of my mental health by seeing a therapist.

You are gained to the unit and therefore belong to the unit and get a patch. Why should there be anything to earn if you already belong? This unit is not like that. I am not sure if it is because the current patch hasn't been cleared by higher AF or what, but they have you ""earn"" your patch by answering trivia about the squadrons leadership. I don't entirely disagree with this but also think that you belong to the squadron therefore the squadron patch is kind of a given.

EqiineArtz,"Hey Reddit, I have a really hard time getting motivated to do anything. I’ve tried different things like counting down from five and the “one small thing at a time” and a few others, and none of them do anything for me. I’ll be sitting there on my bed as I hit one and would not have moved a muscle or even felt like doing so. I’ll get out of my bed (it’s a loft bed so I have to go down stairs which is a pain since I can’t just roll out) and I’ll lay down on the floor and do nothing from there, no matter how much I want to.

There is so much stuff I want and need to do. I need to clean my room, take showers, brush my teeth at night, and more simple stuff like that. I want to learn Japanese, get better at drawing and practise guitar. No matter how much I want to do these things, I literally just can’t. Either I’m too lazy, too annoyed or too depressed to feel like doing anything.

I know other motivation tactics wouldn’t work like “reward yourself after doing something productive” or “meditate” or “go on a walk”. Like the last one is especially stupid, where would I find the motivation to go outside and walk if I don’t have the motivation to brush my teeth of a night or get out of bed.

I feel completely hopeless and I don’t want to waste my time like this, but there’s no way to get myself doing stuff. I’ve tried so many things and none of them work. I don’t even have the motivation to get myself food right now even though I’m really hungry, I’m just laying here on the ground.

I want to be that person who studies all the time and has awesome skills with an organised life, and I know I can do it I just need the motivation to.

Could someone give me any idea of how I should get myself the motivation to do stuff?



TL DR: Literally nothing gets me motivated to do even simple tasks, anyone got ideas?",My friend and I saw the notice saying that there would be an lgbtq meeting and we decided we’d go and just quickly look through the door or something. Once we got there we stood there for five seconds before a teacher told us we could go in and told us it was okay and stuff so we awkwardly shuffled into the room and sat down. We weren’t actually planning on joining in on the meeting or joining the club/group but it was actually really chill there and the people were cool so we decided we’d stay.,"Luckily I live in Australia, and where I live doesn’t have any cases in or around it so there aren’t many restrictions.","I will follow that rule, lmao","That sounds like so much fun! We are going to make posters for the school and I’m excited to do that, and one of the members is requesting we do a bake sale with different flags on each of the cookies. I don’t know if I’d be able to do the bake sale, cause I don’t wanna out myself fully (a lot of people at my school are homophobic, even if they say they aren’t lol.) 
When I walked in there I was really surprised at the people I saw in there (people that I would not have ever guessed being in the lgbtq community) but it was really cool.

Self harm is self harm no matter what you do. Ranging from not eating for periods of time, to choking yourself, burning yourself, hitting yourself, etc. There are too many ways someone can self harm, your problems are real, and your friends laughing was a crap thing for them to do. I wish you the best of luck on your journey <3","I’d send those 24 hours with me bird screaming at me about my smallest mistakes, then have her demand pets and seed. I wouldn’t be able to get a word in as she’d probably be a “speak when spoken to” kinda dude.","Crap, I’m so sorry. I’d imagine it’d feel really shitty right now, (I’ve never been clean for that long, so I’m not sure.)

Try not to stress too much though, cutting is a bad addiction and depression/other mental illnesses can be a bitch and can hit you hard. Remember how you were clean for years! Years! And yes you relapsed after you’ve been clean for a while, but you managed to stay clean for so, so long! Be proud you made it that long, and strive to do better. You can do this! If it ever seems like it’s impossible, just remember you’ve done it before, you’ve managed to fight for so long. You can do it again, I promise.

We are all here for you, and wish you best of luck on your journey <3<3<3","Hello! It’s currently 12am where I live, and I’ve been hit with a random source of inspiration and motivation to help my depression (idk why but I get random sparks like that from time to time) but I don’t get them often, so I really want to use it to help myself now. I want to start something small now to help myself and keep myself motivated to help myself.
I struggle with depression, anxiety, and autism (high functioning), so I was wondering if anyone had any tips to help with those things, I also cut myself.

Even though I want to get help right now, part of me doesn’t want to for a lot of reasons. Like I feel lazy, or like I shouldn’t even bother, and like I don’t deserve to get help, and that I think I should just deal with it cause life isn’t that bad for me, and that I’m a shitty person who shouldn’t bother.
Another  part of me knows that’s not true though, and that I do deserve help and I’m not as horrible as I think I am, and that I’m actually kind of pretty and nice and smart but then I also think that it’s just me saying stuff. 

I’m really conflicted about myself and what I feel right now, it’s a 50/50 between my angel and my demon (idk how to describe it so using that analogy) and I don’t know which way to stray.

Anyway, I just want some encouragement really, something positive I guess, an extra push to start helping myself instead of just sitting there and giving up because I really don’t want to give up right now.

Have a good day/night you guys, <3 <3 <3",Thanks <3,"A lot of time stress can build up subconsciously, and people can have panic attacks or something along those lines without even realising what caused it. I struggle with sh (cutting) and depression myself, so I know what it feels like to hate yourself. Try saying a few kind words to yourself, or leaving up sticky notes on the mirror or places you go to often (like around your room) that say something like “I am...” or “you are...” (something positive lol) that go against your insecurities/hates about yourself. That tactic helps a lot of people.

Personally for me, what let me onto a clean streak of sh (for about a month, until something happened in my life which made me relapse), is meditation. Breathing ones helped me, but try all kinds and see if any work for you.

Lastly, I recommend seeing a professional, and if you can’t do that try finding a friend or family member that your trust to talk about it with. I know personally I can’t talk to people about my problems (like at all, I physically can not talk when someone tries to get me to open up.) So if you can’t talk to anyone in person maybe try those online psychology things (idk how good those are) or just turn to reddit and find an internet stranger lol. If you can’t talk to anyone about it, I’d try getting a notebook or open a word document and try journaling/writing down your issues. It helps to get it out somehow.

I wish you the best of luck, <3","I completely understand, with how my dads girlfriend told my dad about my cuts. For me it felt like my trust had been broken, and I know she felt like she had to tell him, but I still felt a bit betrayed.","Congrats! You should feel happy right now.

About the feeling of relapsing, I totally understand you! So many times I’ve gone clean for a month, then I relapsed for a while then went clean again, rinse and repeat. Currently I’m clean, but I also feel like relapsing everyday, and that’s normal! I’d recommend searching up ways to get the “relief” from sh without actually harming yourself (I’ve heard drawing on yourself with a red pen works for some, and sometimes distracting yourself with other things where you don’t have the opportunity to cut helps too)

Anyways, I hope you can stay clean, and you do relapse don’t stress about it too much, it’s a long road to recovery. Just try your best! <3<3<3","I understand how you feel, when my parents saw my cuts (my dad found out when his girlfriend took me to the beach and saw my cuts when I had to put on sunscreen, so she then told her) he sat me down and forced me to take off my jacket and show him the cuts then tried to get me to talk to him about it (and since I know my father isn’t that understanding of mental health stuff) I also told him it was a one time thing.

My mother and father got into a fight over phone call when I was having a panic attack and he told her, but he “lied” saying that I’ve been doing it recently (which I had, but there was no chance he saw proof of that) and my mother asked me about and i also told her it was a one time thing ages ago. My friend also saw my cuts one time at school, and I told her it was a one time thing.

What I’m saying is I understand what it feels like to be caught, for me it was a feeling of my heart dropping and feeling sick to my stomach, and I lied through it all. Try to stay calm and if your mother is the understanding type try to see if you can explain it to her, but if she’s the type to get mad I’m not sure what to do on that part. Just try not to worry okay. 

If you ever need someone to talk to about anything, you can always dm me, hoping the best for you! <3","Has anything been stressing you out recently? And what were you currently thinking when the feeling to hit yourself come over you (like just what was in your mind at the moment)?
I hope your okay, and if you’ve been feeling depressed or feeling like you hate yourself or just have a gut feeling somethings wrong I’d go seek help from someone, or you can always talk to some internet strangers! I hope you have a good day in spite of what happened this morning <3","I just have a gut feeling I’ll relapse into cutting soon, idk if it’s gonna be in like an hour or tomorrow or even sometime in the week, I just think I’m gonna relapse again really soon. I’ve been feeling really crap lately and idk why. It’s not like life has been particularly bad to me lately, it’s actually been pretty chill but who knows lol. 
Part of me doesn’t want to relapse, another part doesn’t care, and other part wants to start up again really bad, so 2/3 of me are gonna let me relapse, and that’s the majority.
I found two razors today that I forgot to throw away before (I went clean for like a month or two and decided to throw them away, since I always seemed to lose the razors I kept on getting more so when I found them again they just started stacking up. Guess I missed these two lol)
Anyway, I’m scared I’m gonna give into the urge or something I guess lol.

smalltitsusan,"My depression likes to come in waves and with covid I’ve been suffering a pretty severe one this time. To calm myself from the excessive crying or blank stares, I open my journal to dump whatever I feel. Here is the journal entry from yesterday. 

Journaling is my escape from this world and provides a sense of growth when I get to look back a year from now to see how much has changed. It’s a great remedy and treasure.

(I’m going at it day by day, and I know it will get better) 

Journal Entry:

I really just want to sleep

I really just want to get up early in the morning

I really just want to clean me room 

I really just wanna go back to my face routine 

I really just wanna smile effortlessly without remind myself that I need to

I really just wanna sleep without crying 

I really just don’t feel my myself...

Depression has hit me in waves

It comes and goes, like how a carnival ride does. 

I feel pain, I feel nothingness, I feel empty, I feel confused

But sometimes I feel happy 

I always end back here, it always finds its way back

Why

I want to be mentally stable, I don’t know how that’s attainable.

I want to have a positive mindset 

I end up being the opposite

I crash

I crash hard

I fall into the hole of blackness that is bottomless

When will it stop

What are the limits 

There are none. 

I don’t know when it’s going to end

I don’t know when it’s going to start

I could be having a fine month, 

But it could come tmr and it’ll just welcome itself into my life for a few days, weeks, or months. 

It’s not welcomed to stay, but it makes itself comfortable

Depression likes to sit and watch as I break

Depression doesn’t have to be anywhere, so it’ll stay until it wants to go 

I don’t like depression

Who does?

It self invites, disrupts and causes ripples upon ripples

Unstoppable waves that endlessly crash into the peaceful sand 

The sand was just doing fine until the waves came 

Now the sand is damp, wet and not in its right form

With sun, the sand dries up ...

Slowly. 

The sand wants to give up

But it doesn’t

It knows that the other sand friends are dry on the other side

The damp sand has potential to be at that state again

Just have to wait it out

And see","You deserve someone that sees you for what you are without having to prove it time to time. 

I’m glad you left when you did. It was hard but you did it and i hope from here it gets easier ❤️","Glad there is this subreddit, you guys are my support system too!

Cannot compare how bad a miscarriage is compared to having a child die. How can you weigh how bad each one is?

Both people have choices to abort or leave the relationship but how did they get into this situation? They BOTH had sex and they had sex knowing the risks that a baby is possible even with condoms/bc. Those aren’t 100% guarantee. 

When both parties consent to have sex there needs to be support from both ends. 

She will support him leaving if that is his choice and he will support her for not aborting the baby. However if he leaves, there still needs to be support if he isn’t doing his part as a father and taking care of the baby. So, his half of the responsibility is to provide financially.","Oh the point you made about how the daughter misunderstood, that’a a good point! OP if you see this, keep your head up high!","What does the daughter being attracted to the woman have to do with the family, AT ALL? It’s between the ex and the OP. They may not be the picture perfect family, but they are not fucked up by being human and loving who want.","When kids are in the picture it makes things more complicated and they don’t look at the root of why he’s not coming. It’s harder for kids because all they want are for their parents to rekindle their relationship. I can see why they are being distant and have a grudge. It’s a lot on a kid, especially when divorce happens at their young age.","She most likely saw that inviting the father would bring unity to the family, and with him declining she saw that as a rejection to reunite the family. But when he was honest to her about how he felt about the invitation, she got two sides of the story and will hopefully assist the sons.","It would hurt the family more if the ex stayed with him knowing she does not love him anymore.

makeamessfoundation,"I’m in my second to last semester of college and had to take a challenging class out of my wheelhouse for one of my last degree requirements. I knew it was going to be hard and after a couple weeks I just gave up. Being online made it easy to sleep through class and tell myself I’d watch the recorded lecture later but I usually didn’t. I just got into a habit of convincing myself that not doing the work was okay and that I’d play catch up when I felt better. 

My self loathing is really high right now and I’ve had 3 panic attacks within the last 2 hours after doing the math and seeing my grade isn’t salvageable. After dropping out because of my depression and anxiety, my mom offered to pay for me to finish my degree and I’m paralyzed about telling her even though she’ll try to understand and I’m going to pay her for the class. 

I want to blame my depression for my total lack of effort but there were so many times where I could have sat down and tried to do the work and I just didn’t. I didn’t have something more important to do. I wasn’t too stressed.

Who hurt you?","I don’t want to write you a whole ass novel here but I can help with a couple things. My background is in short fiction but I’ve moved to screenwriting. The biggest thing screenwriting has taught me is how to show not tell. You really can’t rely on the typical tropes used in fiction and you’re forced to be as economical as possible in how you give the audience information. You HAVE to reveal things in one of two ways: by what the audience can see, or what the characters say. That’s it. 

For my backstories and relationships I’ve tried not to lean on flashbacks too much and like to reveal things as organically as possible. Example: early in the plot a young woman is in a therapist’s office and says “I’ve been thinking about Chelsea again. I don’t know why.” 

Information you learn from this: the young woman is struggling mentally with something, Chelsea is important even if we don’t know who she is, Chelsea is likely not in her life any more and the young woman hasn’t thought about Chelsea in a while. 

This approach will give you a good setup to unfold the story of Chelsea and the young woman through small revelations like this until you’ve laid enough of a foundation down to drop a bomb like the two of them running into each other, or Chelsea showing up at the young woman’s house covered in blood, or something else that will set the plot into motion.

cluelessbasket,"Bro, what am I supposed to do man... I’m never happy. I don’t know how to be happy. I’ve been depressed out of my mind for the last 14 years. I thought for the past 6 months after meeting this girl and now dating her that I was happy. But now I’m back to feeling in a shit hole and I’m dragging her down with me like I do with everyone else.

And now I feel like I’m shoving her away before she leaves on her own. I’ve tried therapy in and out for several years, it never helps.

Why can’t I just be happy. Why can’t I just love her the way that she loves me. Why can’t I just believe her when she says she’s there for me and that she isn’t going anywhere. Why can’t I just hold onto her instead of make up reasons to let her go.

I see a lot of people in-game wearing fire capes. They all have their personal reasons why they haven't gotten their infernal cape yet, so I'm wondering why some people on Reddit haven't killed Zuk. What is stopping you? Nerves? Fear of failure? Don't know what to do? Some people fail 100+ times. At that point it's time to examine yourself and see what's wrong.  


I've compiled a couple of tips for some people:  


1) blood spells  
Using a lot of food during fight caves? Try bringing blood spells. Healing off the nibblers and anything/everything else can help you save a significant amount of food if you're taking unnecessary damage.  


2) too many inputs  
Some people tend to panic when they get to Zuk. They have to eat, drink a prayer dose, kill the sets, and attack zuk after. Choose one. Drink the prayer potion. Wait for sets to spawn to attack, tag one set, wait for Zuk to attack, tag second set, wait for Zuk to attack, etc. You have more time than you think. Don't panic thinking you have no time to act.  


3) Zuk killed me while I could clearly see him!  
When you reach wave 69, look for shield. That's where Zuk will be. Some people try to hide behind the shield so they have time to calm their nerves. I advise against that. Instead, be close to him when he spawns. You'll know when he starts attacking.  


4) Enemy priority in caves  
During the later waves you need to figure out which enemy to kill first. Personally, I believe you should kill the biggest threat at the time. If you have the mage, the range, and the blob on you at the same time, you should prioritize killing literally whichever one you can looooolll. You may need to tank some damage, but that's what the blood spells are for.   


5) Trap the enemies  
I made a quick doodle for you, wait no I didn’t.


6) I panic  
Stop panicking.  


\*yes you can also use the shield on wave 3 to see where Zuk will spawn. Many people will forget this spawn so it may be easier for people to just see where the shield is.

CuzIamcreep,"I'm 28 and I've been depressed since I was 12. I never had any support. I never had any friends or anyone that truly fell in love with me. 
I got in the best university of my country but got kicked out due to financial issues. I was never able to get a job. I spend most of my days sleeping so I don't feel anything.
Last year I got closer to this amazing girl. She rocked my world. She made me feel better about myself, she made me want to fight against my depression and social anxiety, she pushed me forward to try to go back to college. We almost got together. Almost. Things drastically changed after the pandemics and now she had moved in with someone else. I lost her completely, as she doesn't even want to talk to me or have me around as friend anymore.
My only friend has gotten herself a relationship and she'll completely ignore me, unless she needs advice or cry about being played on.
My family doesn't support me. In any manners. I can't afford getting professional help.
I feel completely alone. I feel even God hates me. I'm thinking about ending things soon because I can't handle so much pain and loneliness anymore.",Bly Manor has changed my life 😍,"Trust me, I've spend time enough when I was younger trying to look good and appear to be mentally stable. It never changed absolutely anything. I was only used when people had no better options or when they just wanted to play with my feelings. I had given up. I had locked myself inside my own bubble for years until I met her. I never even intended to fall in love, it just happened. And happened because she gave me reasons to pursue her.

Not even on apps like Tinder I was able to meet people. They rejected not only for my looks, but once they found out about the things I like too. They're disappointed to discover I'm no material girl, that I like reading, sci-fi and video games.

Yes, I think about my family. But no one thinks about *me.* I'm the only person who can see the pain I'm struggling with. No one else cares. They expect me to always pretend everything is okay and smile. They'd judge me even if I sought help, they say therapy is for crazy people and it wouldn't look good on them. Again it's always about *them*. Also, I have no money for therapy. I'd have tried if I had this chance. But it's not an option.","1- I lost the girl I loved forever. She was the only joy I had in my life, even if for her I was just a temporary fun. She motivated me to try to fight my depression and social anxiety, to improve my looks, to try to change my life for better. My happiest days were by her side. She was the only person I felt comfortable being around. She made me laugh and feel desired like no one else had done before. We almost got together last year and then everything changed. Now she has moved in with someone else and we probably won't even see each other or talk anymore. Yet, it wouldn't be enough because I don't wanna be friends after she taught me to love her. 
2- My only friend has gotten in a relationship and ignores me, except for when she wants to ask for advice or cry because she thinks she's being played on.
3- Tumblr was the only place I could vent my mental health and my daily problems. Until a homophobic freak started to harass me and stalk me 24/7. Her blog is almost entirely dedicated to mock me and insult me on a daily basis.

I'm done being lonely. I'm done not being able to be loved. I'm done being everyone's joke.

No student is perfect. But if you can find the one or two classes that’ll impact you the most, try to focus on those grades before any of your others. And try to take it slow.

Then she laughed as she read some memes out loud from Facebook as his kids were crying. 

Then she referred to their home as “my house” while he was still alive. 

She opted for palliative care without including anyone in the conversation and then acted outraged that his grandchild (me) or children would feel snubbed. 

Then she left at 6 saying “I can’t wait to watch the shows I want to watch whenever I want instead of having to watch his shows!”  

My mom and I stayed by his bedside. He died at 8:45. We called her and she literally said “oh gosh, thanks for calling”. I texted to ask if she was coming to say goodbye to him and she said “no thanks!”

mezo19,"(19M)For the past year and a half I've been feeling depressed. My therapist says I don't suffer from depression, but the feeling got worse over time until 9 months ago, when quarantine started here in my country and it gave me the opportunity to do some meditation about my past problems with alcohol and smokes. But I kept having this kind of ""need"" to get in my car, go to the highway and start speeding, not for fun, but because I'm a petrolhead and it gives me some adrenaline that makes me feel alive, like if it sparked something in my chest that's been dormant for a long time. But the counterpart is that I think about losing control and dying in a car accident instantly (hopefully just me, not involving anyone else).
Some nights I stay up, staring at the ceiling thinking about my life, feeling lonely and this ""need"" knocks at the door, but I try to control it. The only things keeping me from doing this is that I'm coward enough to not do it and my parents/dog love, the only love I felt real since I broke up with my girlfriend early 2019.","Hit myself trying to block a jab while boxing with a friend, left with a haematoma and some blood in my right eye.",You believe in something stronger than trust,The chosen one,"The vibe makes me feel amazing and it's kinda hypnotic, fuckin love it.

Not to mention if they do find cancer, how am I gonna get it removed since my insurance will be cut off in November. (Live in California if that makes a difference).

It was 2 years ago today that my father died. I ended up getting notified by my grieving mother (one of his ex wives), just the sadness on her face shattered my heart into pieces. I knew right away that alcohol was the reason why my father passed away. Alcohol consumed his life, and I felt like I could’ve done something to stop him from drowning his sorrows in it. Every once in a while I think to myself, maybe I could’ve done something to prevent him from poisoning his body with this vile substance. I remember I held all my emotions in for about a week. When I returned to work the following week, I just kept to myself and tried to avoid any conversations with my coworkers. Once I left with my check by the end of the night, I immediately left. When I drove back home that night, I couldn’t help but burst out into tears, saying out loud “I miss you dad, please come back.” Thinking of the memories had with him. But in reality, I knew he no longer existed on this planet. 

My childhood was fairly great with my father until my teenage years, when alcohol started consuming him more. When he got his second divorce, I knew alcohol was an issue for him (both of his divorces stemmed from alcoholism). I ran away from his house multiple times because I was tired of seeing him passed out drunk. I knew by this point, I vowed not to let drink a single drop of alcohol in my entire life and so far I haven’t (I guess you can say I’m Straight-Edge lol). 

Please if there is any parent out there struggling with alcoholism do it for your kid(s). They would want you to be there to witness their accomplishments (college graduation, getting married, having children). I wish I could say the same about my father, but unfortunately that won’t be the case. I think about him everyday, and just wish he was around still. Please learn from my dad’s mistakes.

I love you dad, I wish I could’ve been there to save you from this disease. I hope you’re proud of what I accomplish in the upcoming future.","There’s a saying I like to follow, “Just let the ass pass!” 😄","I ended up buying my dream bass, the Rickenbacker 4003.

I thought her instagram name was kinda funny so I texted her, we got into a conversation, really started to get along. We started being on the phone every day, I remember waiting for 5 pm bc that's when the school for her ended. 

To be fair there was a break of habit once before her suicide attempt, but we got along again shortly afterwars.. 

Because of covid I could never visit her at the hospital but a week ago we met again after a pretty long time.. I thought the day went well and took the train home when she had to get back to the hospital.. While I was still on the train she texted me.. ""Hey, after today I realized that I don't have feelings for you, but we can stay friends"".

I don't know what I did wrong or what I said, maybe it's my height? I'm 1.66 and she's 1.86 so a lit bigfer but I didn't really mind after getting to know her better. Back to topic;

I never really had many friends, I mean yeah there are peopke I see in class and get along with but we don't do things outside of class, I felt lonely before I met her but talking to her every day took that away.. 

Now that she's gone out of my life, like anyone does, it's all back and worse. I feel just lonely, it has been like that for so long but now that I had someone again after a long time it hurts to be let down again.

Forgotten_Soul2001,"I a 19-year-old male have been battling with depression for as long as I can remember. I don't have much support and it seems as though it's getting worse and harder to deal with. Getting out of bed, cleaning, talking about how I feel, and the list goes on. I have been dealing with abuse from my family along with it for being who I am. I cannot talk about it anymore. I have a very supportive boyfriend [19], but he blames himself for me being so depressed and very suicidal. He says that all he does is make me feel bad and he is trying to keep me from feeling the way I do. He feels like he isn't enough at this point and it's making me feel like shit knowing that he feels like shit. I am just trying to make it look like everything is going fine inside my head when in fact it's just chaos. I am also trans and it's also playing a role. I am going back to therapy, but I don't think it will help as much. My boyfriend just wants to see me safe and happy, but the little voice in my head is now yelling at me almost everyday. My family doesn't pay any mind to my feelings nor do they even care about them. I cannot talk to them because all they do is ignore me. I cannot be happy for more than a day and then I spiral again. I don't know what to do about it. I don't want to call crisis lines at all anymore. It's not because I don't want to, but because I can't. I am terrified of hospitalizing myself because of the fact that I am really scared. I don't take medicine because it didn't help me. I just wanted therapy and support. I blame myself for a lot of stuff my family hates about me. A lot of the things that a lot of people hate about me. I want to move, but I cannot. I want to do the things I have to, but I can't. I want to be happy and I struggle with it. I am happy in the relationship I have now. I am happy that I am loved by someone. I am happy that I have some form of support, but it makes me feel so lonely knowing I don't have my family and other people do. How I will never have that special bond with them at all because I turned out to be a certain way. I can't help, but feel like it's just a matter of time before I break down again. I don't know.",Thank you for your advice. I will certainly take note of that. Anything helps me figure out what to do.,"I [19M] am in a long time relationship with my boyfriend [19M] and I am having trouble getting to a comfortable spot in my sex life. I was raped for a very long time and abused by an ex boyfriend. I am comfortable with being touched, kissed, held, and I am trusting my boyfriend more and I am very proud of myself for getting this far thanks to him for being patient and working with me. He keeps talking to me about wanting to have intercourse. Him and I tried last night, but I was really scared and I was freezing up. I kept needing to leave and come back. He was okay with me constantly leaving and coming back. He even was willing to try what I wanted him to do, but he wasn't in the mood anymore. I can't get passed being afraid of the pain and being very scared of being hurt. I trust he would stop and we could try again later, but I feel bad for making it out to be a lot of work. I want to try again, but it's the pain. He is still willing to try anything to make me feel better about it. I thought about using toys before. We also have a lot of lube, but it's not very good. I don't know. I am able to handle toys (dildos, buttplugs are always fun, but...). 

I am also into some kinky stuff. Paddles, whips, chains, shackles, ball gags, leash and collar. I tried to introduce this to my relationship and I did talk to my boyfriend about it before hand. I bought a collar, leash, and a pair of cuffs. Problem is that I wasted my money because my boyfriend is not interested in involving any of these exciting toys to the bedroom and I kinda feel like I wasted my money. I didn't hear him in the store at the time tell me that he was uncomfortable and I feel bad for making him feel uncomfortable in the bed sheets by involving the kink stuff. He also feels bad for judging me for my kinks and he just feels a little bad for me buying this stuff for myself only, only to not to get to use them. We did talk about his feelings and my feelings about them. It's good that I know where he stands on this and where I do as well. He told me that it is because he doesn't know his own strength, but I love rough stuff. He just doesn't want to hurt me. I wanted to buy a BDSM safety book. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.

Edit: I talked to him about any of his kinks and he said that he doesn't have one. He has watched porn, but he said that he watched just about everything and he really doesn't find it hot or he feels that he won't get any enjoyment from it.","So, we did talk about this before. I forgot to mention that he is not into anything. He just likes vanilla sex, so I have no idea how to introduce any of my kinks and sexual fantasies in our bedroom.

As far as anal goes, we are taking it slow. Just really hard to get over being forced by someone in the past. He is taking care of me along the way and giving me support. He isn't making me go through with what he wants me to do.

Thank you.","I'm a 19 year old male. I just got hired at a job. Because of a situation at home I have been having trouble getting to work twice. The first time was that my job didn't tell me where to look for my schedule or tell me a time. We'll, now it's the third time and I am freaking out. I don't know what to do right now. I am being sexually harassed and assaulted at home by mom and her boyfriend. I had suicidal thoughts and very high anxiety and I was struggling to keep myself from harming myself in any way. My boyfriend picked me up and took me to his place (30 minutes away from my house) in his roommates car. His car is very not safe to drive and I don't have a ride. I don't know how to explain to my boss what happened or what to even do. I am on limited time to get answers. I feel like I am going to get fired. I am so panicked.","I am [19M] and I don't know what to do. I want to move out, but if I do it would really screw over my mom. She cannot afford to move to another place and I feel super stuck here. I am FTM transgender. I am not getting any positive support from my family at all. My mom claims that she cannot work and it's really, really driving me crazy that I have to stay at home and around really narcissistic people. I get super, super drained everyday and it just makes me feel crazy. I have been recently questioning a lot of things like why her arthritis would hold her from working. There are jobs out there that she can get. I have a job myself and she claims that the government housing she is living in would make me pay rent. I have to hand the money to her and she will pay. She complains about not being rich and wants me to work while she stays home and does whatever. I don't really fit the job I currently have because the conditions aren't very great and I feel very uncomfortable with the people I work with. I want to move so I can get a better job, most likely go to school. My mom claims that she is tired of me living with her, but wants me to stay home because she says that housing will make her down grade to a smaller home since she lives with my brother. She has a boyfriend that stays here too, but he never explained his living situation to me. Her boyfriend is a pervert towards me, sexually assaulted me again today and my mom tells me to wear something else if I don't want him to look at me. (I still dress ""feminine"" for a guy, but I don't mind it. I wear mostly men's clothes anyway, but sometimes I will go with old clothes because I still need to go clothes shopping.. I am broke.) 

I don't feel safe here. It makes me sick to feel this way or to be told to change for her boyfriend to not stop the harassment. I still have my breasts and this time he came over and just looked down my shirt. I feel really gross, well, worse about my body than I should have to. My mom knows and encourages his actions. It's been like this since I was a kid and they were both just too into harassing me in such a manner; touching/groping my butt, or looking down my shirt. Even asking for me to pull down my pants and underwear to show them my penis. My mom got with her boyfriend when I was 15 and a half. I find it so shit because my mom and I would watch crime shows and this man had molested and assaulted kids, but his own daughter and then she comments on how evil his behaviors were. Her boyfriend did it to me and I almost said something about how ironic it was that she is letting it happen and yet she will not talk about it. I am just getting so sick of it. I just want to pack all my stuff up and go, but I can't because she will not let me. I don't know what to do. I don't want to spend the next 2-5 years putting up with bigotry and such a disgustingly stressful situation. Especially when I have a lot going on already. I was thinking about trying to contact my biological dad and seeing what's going on with him. 

Another note is that I will be going to spend time with my boyfriend and then I will be getting spammed with texts about when I am coming home after my mom tells me that I am an adult and I can do whatever. I also get told to do something and I don't care about what is, I will do it, but she just comes back a minute after and just keeps telling me over and over. I will tell her okay when I am cooking or eating. She comes back a second after, peaks her head over ""I thought I told you something, *missy*."" I would explain that I know, but I am hungry and I will get it done after. She gets pissy and I just want to stress out even more because she will keep going on about how I just woke up and I am being so lazy. Or I am not doing what she wants. I do it after, but not when I am cooking. I don't know what to do, let it burn?? She even told someone that she would call the cops if I transition. I want to see that happen. I don't like my mom or her boyfriend. I don't care if she gave birth to me. She isn't a real mother. I feel really alone in the house and I feel like she views me as nothing, but a childish embarrassment and a toy. I feel like a punching bag and sex doll. The boyfriend honestly needs his throat punched. I don't like where I am right now.","Congratulations that must feel so great! You might not know me, but I mean this from the bottom of my heart that I am so proud of you! You have a lovely day! I hope you receive more positive vibes and lots of love! ❤️😁","So, I am a 19 gay and transgender male. I grew up in a very closed minded family. I am currently dealing with a lot. Didn't know who else, but our community to give advice. I don't have a great therapist. I have a really bad one. I am not here to vent about that, but I am getting into a very dark space in my mind again, I have a history of sui cide. I don't know what else to say. I feel like am losing this battle of all it clashing together. I mostly stay at my boyfriend's place to hide from it all. I am being molested and sexually assaulted by my mom and her boyfriend. I have no proof of them doing this and it drives me crazy. They started doing this after I came out. It's making me feel super unsafe. My boyfriend knows, but cannot do anything about it. I stay in my room and besides that I go to work. I am dealing with grief over my grandfather who passed away a year ago and losing the only family member who loved me even when I came out because he didn't know anyway. He had dementia and a brain injury and I was very, very close to him because I had no father figure in my life besides him. I am conflicted with hating my mom, but having no other parent, I have an attachment to her anyway which is really damaging me really deeply. I can't move because it would result in my mom becoming homeless. She claims that she cannot work because she has arthritis in her arms, neck, finger, and back. She tells me that I am an adult, but talks down to me. I have to closet myself, dead name myself, and misgender myself to make my family happy and it's draining me. I have been dealing with a lot of anger and sadness because I don't want to celebrate anything this year because of Papa being gone. I just got to grieve because I dumped my ex and just got away without him killing me. He pretended to be gay for sex and turned around and started to beat on me. He even permanently injured my left shoulder. He popped my arm out of the socket and didn't put in back in until it was about 5 minutes.

I came home and my brother told me that he didn't ask for me to come back. My mom tells me to just get over being raped and she told me so. Her boyfriend tells me that I didn't get beat hard enough because I am still annoying. I am called fat for eating a burger after not eating for an entire day. I didn't want to come back because I knew they would be the same. My boyfriend treats me very well and I am super happy with who I am with, but my family is what is dragging me to the freaking depths. I want to get a new therapist, but there aren't really any that help LBGTQ individuals in Ohio. I honestly have no options. I have to stay ""home"" for my brother's sake of not being homeless or living with his pedo dad. I have a lot of history with my mom letting boyfriend's and her ex husband touch me and look at me as a kid to my early teens. The current boyfriend from my 16th birthday to my 19th birthday. I feel really nasty about myself. I have a lot of depression and a lot of issues about strangers touching me without me seeing them or knowing them. My brother's dad has raised me from infancy to my 13th birthday. My mom denies her boyfriend would do anything to harm me because he has a daughter of his own. Real smart thinking, I know. I really haven't had any change over these years. I came out 11 or so times and nothing. My family either ignores me or tells me that I am crazy. I feel really crazy. I've been just really close to having an emotional break down and don't know what to do or say anymore. I am breaking down slowly and I feel like I shouldn't have came out in the first place. Or that it's all my fault that they just hate me. Or that I am not a good kid for even being the way I am. I have days where I just love me don't get me wrong, but I don't have my family because of it and it's so painful to know that they would only care because I am saying that I am something I am not. I say anything about the LBGTQ and they are all over saying anything to make it seem bad. I am proud to be brave and be who I need to be, but it's hard to just always deal with it. It's really hard to hear my own mom say that she will call the cops to remove me off the property if I came around with a beard. It also hurts to be hated by someone society told you would keep you safe, but really just doesn't care. I feel like I did something wrong or didn't do enough. I don't know how to get away from that feeling. I don't know how to stand up to them and say, ""You know what? I am done"". I have, but I don't get them to listen. My mom and I did go through therapy and it didn't help us get any closer. Instead it made things worse for me. She eventually took me out of therapy and I did try to overdose because I couldn't take it in my freshman year. I didn't want to continue if this was just my life. It was very stressful and still is. No one sees through the curtain she throws over her personality. I talk about what happens and then my friends tell me how she is. That I am just lying and then she turns around and is the same person. It really puts me off. She acts nice, does some nice stuff and then she would turn around and tell me that I am a piece of shit and that I am just super embarrassing. 

I don't know. I hate it. I have issues with a lot of sexual stuff too that correlates with all the past and current issues I go through. My boyfriend and I have oral fine, but I am terrified of anal sex of any kind. My boyfriend and I talked about it, but I just keep getting PTSD episodes if he even goes near. I think I might be ready, but I don't know if I can even jump in or step into those new waters. I am a wreck, not to mention that I was also raped there by the ex many, many painful times. I could perform anal sex on myself, but I cannot let anyone else get near me without freaking out a lot.. Even by myself in my own bed is still pretty scary, but I manage. I can't go to my mom about it because she would again either ignore or mock me. She makes fun of rape a lot and I can't have her treat me like I wanted it to happen to me like she did when I came home. Sometimes still does. I wanted to throw out my blankets because it did and still does bring back sore memories of what I went through and when I mentioned this to her or even tried to myself, she told me to keep them for camping trips and sleep with them anyway. I have to get over it. This pissed my off because I feel really sore already and then she has to go on and tell me that what I am feeling doesn't matter. It's really tiring to deal with stress, depression, and try to act like nothing is wrong, but to end up being told that my feelings aren't valid. She would go through depression and then all of a sudden the whole world has to stop and take care of her mess while I work, while I do what I need to do, and try please them. I just don't understand it. I am too exhausted to.","So, I have a job as a cashier and I just got hired. I'm ftm and I'm unsure how to tell my manager without coming across as informal/unprofessional. I really don't want to be dead named or be called by the wrong pronouns since I'm out publicly. I could careless about what my family would think of me, but it's just important for me to know because I've asked about this before for people to tell me that they don't know or that I am on my own with this. I've taken classes to learn on the job and leadership skills only to get the same answer. I want to know your experiences with this and anything to watch out for. Obviously I can get let go, but it's a probability I won't since their against discrimination against gender identity.","I am currently job hunting and I went through classes to learn what to do in a job interview. Other stuff related to that. Well, I was the only transgender person there and had some trouble getting answers to questions related to what to do as a transgender in the work place. How to come out to your manager, how to deal with harassment, etc. I'm female to male by the way and 19. No one has really taught this stuff to me. I really don't know if what I should even do.

On another note, I know a girl who is seeing an old friend that went to my high school. We didn't talk much, but his girlfriend seems to have been interested in being friends with me. I go by Dustin now and I'm dead naming. She knows this and calls me he/him pronouns and by my preferred name to my face, but I got curious and asked her how she addresses me around her friends. It made me feel sick to find out that she calls me by the wrong pronouns and uses my birth name to other people in conversation to ""make sure there is no confusion"". I want to yell because she knows my feelings and how I am trying to keep my birth name to be obscured to those who know me as Dustin. I don't like what she's doing, she even told her neighbor that she kinda looks like me which also makes me feel like I can't pass. This girl really bothers me. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt and just say that she might not know better, but I just can't without feeling worse about her doing this because she knows. I want to work with her to not hurt her feelings, but also get her to stop this crap. It's bothering me.",I love the look on his face in that photo. He looks like a very goody cat. Like he just loves to play and do whatever a goofball cat does in his day/night. So cute. He looks like a funny cat.,"She just likes to play fetch. Right after she walked away, she played with the bottle cap. Then brought it back after a moment and just kept repeating that. She doesn't really bring her bottle caps as gifts. She was being super playful at 3 in the morning.","Your words of encouragement really help. I have a therapist, but not a good one so I'm on the hunt for a better one until I find the right person to work with me rather than around me. I need someone to actually listen and not try to repeat herself over and over when it's really not great advice. I have friends and I have my family (my boyfriend and a sister) to be there for me. Really not sure if I am pregnant. Still just stressed about the possibility. I am not on track for my transition, just trying to get on hormones. I know why I would be hormonal. It just causes a lot of dysphoria and it's just overwhelming. Since being with my boyfriend and spending more time with him I have really been having a lot of that anxiety, just here and there. Not too bad. I have been just absolutely wrecked by my dysphoria because when it comes back it's just 10x worse. I will put the baby first because I understand that kids have needs and it's important to care about them. I love kids and I love my supportive boyfriend because he makes me feel a lot better, but even then it just makes me feel like crap to have all this going on. On top of that having my mom's boyfriend being creepy towards me since I was 15. I really just feel like my safety is compromised because of them being really unsupportive of me and being creepy. If I am pregnant, I am going to move since I don't like what's happening. I want the best for my family.","Not a problem. I hope whatever is going on gets better for you. I am sorry to hear that you're not doing well, but I really do wish you the best.",Thank you. Your words of support really help. I really hope that you are doing well in these times as well.,"So, I'm going through a lot lately. It's been a mess for my anxiety and now I'm just at a really low point with my mental health. I'm a 19 year old ftm transgender. I'm just really stressed. I am going through a pregnancy scare which is causing just a tidal wave of dysphoria for me. My boyfriend is trying his best to be as supportive as possible because he really doesn't know what I am going through right now because for one he isn't trans and he doesn't have the reproductive system to give birth. He supports me through anything I go through and do on my own and around him as well. I'm just having a really hard time trying to deal with this and stress about my family not wanting to support me about coming out as transgender. We did use contraceptives, but we are worried that they failed and now we're on our way to being dads too soon. We want kids, but we never talked about when or how we were to have them. We discussed a bit about me giving birth, but we were still unsure. We have issues with our families and haven't told them about the possibility of them becoming grandparents yet, but we plan when we find out for sure. I am just kinda panicking at the moment. I have been secretly panicking for a while, but haven't expressed this until now. I do talk to my boyfriend about my overwhelming anxiety about this whole situation, but it's still not helping. I go to therapy, but my therapist doesn't seem to understand where I am coming from with this. I feel really icky about this whole thing..I don't have much support besides friends who really don't understand my problems either. I am planning on going to a doctor as well (so don't worry about that.) I am just feeling dysphoric about having to see a doctor and possibly being misgendered or having problems. On top of that having risks of getting hurt or harassed by people. I don't know what to do either. I have friends who are willing to help me with the baby, but I don't know about my family who already abuse me and hurt me all the time. If I am with child I will pack up and move since it's for the safety of my baby and me. I just don't know where I am going to go. Another issue is that my mom would be homeless if I do go. I feel badly, but I don't know what else to do. She's on a housing program and she is to live in a three bedroom house since I am still under her roof. When I leave she has to move to a two bedroom house. She lives with my brother who is 14 years of age. I am just torn right now. I don't like my mom, but I don't want to hurt her or my brother either just because of something I really tried to prevent. It really bothers me.",Thank you for the explanation.

Will that work?"" No, because gluten and dairy aren't the same. I also hate that employee's at a fast food chain or restaurant don't know what items contain dairy or if they cross contaminate their food. I also hate that they don't have an allergy menu. I call and ask about food with a new restaurant and they never know about their food. I really think that people should be taught what is dairy and what isn't. People could die if they make a mistake. My family and I went to a restaurant that had everything either cooked in butter or made with some kind of dairy product. I asked for my meal to be dairy free and told them that I am allergic and I got my meal covered in butter. It was melted in the other food on the plate as well, so I asked them to remake it. The waitress told me it was dairy free and I about yelled because it was Father's day and I was grieving. I just asked her to send it back. She told me to remove the chicken because it didn't have butter, but I had to explain cross contamination to her. She took it back after trying to argue with me about what dairy is and butter isn't dairy.","I have seen an LBGTQ therapist, but I have no idea where to go and how to see her. I did talk a little bit with her, but my mom made me stop seeing her. This was when I first came out. I really need to start looking. Just don't know where to go and how to get there.","So, I'm a 19-year-old ftm and I'm having some issues with my therapist. The office I go through doesn't know how to deal with LBGTQ issues. I talk to her and she doesn't seem to listen to me. I'm struggling with my family no longer being my support since I came out to them. I've also had more issues when I was a little older being molested by my mom's boyfriend. She even knew and asked him to be inappropriate towards me as a minor and more. I really don't want a relationship with her, but I've tried to make my feelings clear to her about my depression and the way she treats me. Anytime I mention being trans or anything she doesn't like to read/hear she just ignores me. She puts me aside. My mom and I don't have a relationship with each other. I stated that to my therapist and she just keeps saying that I need to stop trying to force a relationship with my mom and just learn to let go when I have. I stopped writing the letters a while ago and I've stopped hanging around at home. I can't move yet, but my therapist keeps going back and tell me that she hopes to get me to a point where I can fix the relationship between me and my mom. I am getting annoyed because she knows what's going on and that she's letting her boyfriend do some inappropriate stuff to me and she's letting him be verbally abusive towards me for no reason.

I'm also annoyed because she doesn't understand what I'm talking about when I mention anything about how I feel about my gender. It's really frustrating that I spend time talking with someone who is paid to talk to me about why I might feel the way I do. I understand that she might not understand because she herself is not trans or trained to deal with transgender problems, but I want to be understood. I'm try to make sense. Even if I explain what I am saying to her, it seems like she isn't listening to me. We would talk to each other in an entire session and then the next session I have to repeat. I feel like a broken record. It's stressful. I have no access to LBGTQ therapists that will accept my insurance and I'm at a loss. I want to switch so I don't have to feel worse than I did before the therapy session. I want someone who would understand. I just want a little help. I can talk more about this, just ask me for more information if it is needed. I have a lot of stress these days.",Really made my day. Cute cat. I have never seen a cat that sleeps on their face until now. Love this so much. Thanks for sharing! 😋❤️,"I would do the same thing. I love this so much. So much love, support, and devotion for someone like that goes a long way. I love the relationship these sisters have for each other. I would do anything for a sibling like that. It's so beautiful and about made me cry today.","Aww, that's sweet. I needed a hug today. Thank you fluffy. I hope someone returns the favor someday.",Yep. I feel that one right now. I get it all the freaking time. I hate it.,"I am a man. I stated that first hand. I have a boyfriend who found a place to rent and I'm moving in with him. I told my mom about it and she asked my what I would do about food and I just told her it was non of her concern really. She scoffed of course. I did move out once and tried zero contact, but my ex beat me up and raped me. I stayed as long as I could until the guy almost killed me and then I had my mom come get me when she started telling me that she knew he would beat me up. She didn't know why and the guy wasn't even gay, but only wanted one thing. I didn't even like him. Only thought I did and I realized that too late in the relationship when his mental state got worse. I'm dealing with PTSD and all my family does is actually trigger that. Permanent reminders of all the things I went through, so I know I have to leave. I'm glad you did give me advice, but telling me it's okay to kill myself is better than here doesn't really make me feel great. Especially when I am suicidal. The only thing is that they would make it about themselves if I go through with taking my own life. I do want to sometimes, but I'm trying not to for my boyfriend. He just proposed to me and I really don't want him to feel like it was him or he wasn't good enough. I get strong feelings of wanting to die here. Like I knew I would eventually feel since coming back in January. I really hate these feelings, but it's them and the depression. They make it all worse. Then pretend to not have any part in it at all. I have to tell her that I am moving anyway so my brother isn't homeless. They're on government housing and if I am out of the house, then they have to move to a two bedroom house. That takes a while and she loses food stamps. I have to get on food stamps and get on insurance so I can do all these things very soon.","So, I'm 19 female to male and I've had issues with my mom and her boyfriend. I really don't understand why he gives the issues he does, but lately I've been feeling worse and worse. I have depression and anxiety and all of that has just been pounding on me. I've been trying to defend myself for many years, but it's getting worse. So I've been wanting to just tell my mom and her boyfriend to shove it. I just can't anymore. Her boyfriend touches my ass and calls me sexy. He even kissed me a few times when I was a minor and I still feel messed up he is just creepy towards me and I'm having issues with them being assholes. I have been trying to be nice about them being the way they are to me. Writing letters to my mom because I have issues discussing things face to face with her most of the time. I am planning on moving soon and I feel horrible about cutting all contact because I'm just hurt all the time. I know I'm going to feel better in the long run, but I just don't feel good. I am miserable honestly. My mental health is back to being dangerously low and I'm scared of her boyfriend. I am scared to even say anything about him using the wrong name or pronouns, him touching me. Or doing anything to me. My mom knows about her boyfriend being this way to me and it really sucks. I try to do something on my own and my mom will say okay, then turn around and say no. I am getting really tired and dizzy from all of this. I have demanded her to call me by my name because eventually I am going to be on my own and I will be living my own life. I don't know if she should talk to my therapist about all of this because I'm not getting through to her. Her boyfriend won't listen to me either and she wants to marry this guy.

I'm just feeling like a terrible son. I at one point did call CPS when I was 17, but they didn't do anything to help me because I was 18 in three months. They just came out, talked my mom and the reason that she said he was innocent was because he had a daughter and he said he would never do that to me. She watched this happen to me and let it happen because I'm not ""normal."" I feel gross now. She did the same thing when her ex husband touched me and she said that daddies do that to show their love. I had an eating disorder after a while because I was made fun of for being fat (which I wasn't) so I just ended up slowly starving myself. She calls me fat even though she knows that I went through all that. She even let's her boyfriend call me fat after I eat one thing even if that was the first thing I ate all day. He tells me to watch my weight or my boyfriend would leave me. I tried to say that he wouldn't, but he just laughed and told me to watch it happen to me anyway. My mom just keeps telling me that love isn't unconditional. I'm having really messed up thoughts lately. That I'm either fat or that I am better off dead. I don't know what to say or do at this point. It's all abuse. There's just so much I can take and I can't take that much. I'm afraid that he would hit me or that he would touch me more. I don't know how they would act out if I start telling him what I want from them. I am going to start hormones and once my voice starts dropping they might do something then. I want to be freer than I am. I am wearing clothes I want, but my mom is trying to push gender roles on me again. Then she will buy girl's clothes for me. Especially when it's my birthday. She just keeps making things worse for me. I feel like shaving my head or just screaming at them. No one here listens to me. I try and then they pretend like everything with me is okay. My mom even told me that she doesn't think I would kill myself, but I have tried before and even that she puts aside. I feel like I want to die and I just don't want to hurt anyone. I don't want to hurt myself. I am so tired all the time. She argues that she just doesn't want to agree with me and I'm just angry. I keep having panic attack dreams about her. They're so stressful. I told her, but she just laughs at me. Any advice would be nice. Thank you."
Forgotten_Soul2001,"I a 19-year-old male have been battling with depression for as long as I can remember. I don't have much support and it seems as though it's getting worse and harder to deal with. Getting out of bed, cleaning, talking about how I feel, and the list goes on. I have been dealing with abuse from my family along with it for being who I am. I cannot talk about it anymore. I have a very supportive boyfriend [19], but he blames himself for me being so depressed and very suicidal. He says that all he does is make me feel bad and he is trying to keep me from feeling the way I do. He feels like he isn't enough at this point and it's making me feel like shit knowing that he feels like shit. I am just trying to make it look like everything is going fine inside my head when in fact it's just chaos. I am also trans and it's also playing a role. I am going back to therapy, but I don't think it will help as much. My boyfriend just wants to see me safe and happy, but the little voice in my head is now yelling at me almost everyday. My family doesn't pay any mind to my feelings nor do they even care about them. I cannot talk to them because all they do is ignore me. I cannot be happy for more than a day and then I spiral again. I don't know what to do about it. I don't want to call crisis lines at all anymore. It's not because I don't want to, but because I can't. I am terrified of hospitalizing myself because of the fact that I am really scared. I don't take medicine because it didn't help me. I just wanted therapy and support. I blame myself for a lot of stuff my family hates about me. A lot of the things that a lot of people hate about me. I want to move, but I cannot. I want to do the things I have to, but I can't. I want to be happy and I struggle with it. I am happy in the relationship I have now. I am happy that I am loved by someone. I am happy that I have some form of support, but it makes me feel so lonely knowing I don't have my family and other people do. How I will never have that special bond with them at all because I turned out to be a certain way. I can't help, but feel like it's just a matter of time before I break down again. I don't know.",Thank you for your advice. I will certainly take note of that. Anything helps me figure out what to do.,"I [19M] am in a long time relationship with my boyfriend [19M] and I am having trouble getting to a comfortable spot in my sex life. I was raped for a very long time and abused by an ex boyfriend. I am comfortable with being touched, kissed, held, and I am trusting my boyfriend more and I am very proud of myself for getting this far thanks to him for being patient and working with me. He keeps talking to me about wanting to have intercourse. Him and I tried last night, but I was really scared and I was freezing up. I kept needing to leave and come back. He was okay with me constantly leaving and coming back. He even was willing to try what I wanted him to do, but he wasn't in the mood anymore. I can't get passed being afraid of the pain and being very scared of being hurt. I trust he would stop and we could try again later, but I feel bad for making it out to be a lot of work. I want to try again, but it's the pain. He is still willing to try anything to make me feel better about it. I thought about using toys before. We also have a lot of lube, but it's not very good. I don't know. I am able to handle toys (dildos, buttplugs are always fun, but...). 

I am also into some kinky stuff. Paddles, whips, chains, shackles, ball gags, leash and collar. I tried to introduce this to my relationship and I did talk to my boyfriend about it before hand. I bought a collar, leash, and a pair of cuffs. Problem is that I wasted my money because my boyfriend is not interested in involving any of these exciting toys to the bedroom and I kinda feel like I wasted my money. I didn't hear him in the store at the time tell me that he was uncomfortable and I feel bad for making him feel uncomfortable in the bed sheets by involving the kink stuff. He also feels bad for judging me for my kinks and he just feels a little bad for me buying this stuff for myself only, only to not to get to use them. We did talk about his feelings and my feelings about them. It's good that I know where he stands on this and where I do as well. He told me that it is because he doesn't know his own strength, but I love rough stuff. He just doesn't want to hurt me. I wanted to buy a BDSM safety book. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.

Edit: I talked to him about any of his kinks and he said that he doesn't have one. He has watched porn, but he said that he watched just about everything and he really doesn't find it hot or he feels that he won't get any enjoyment from it.","So, we did talk about this before. I forgot to mention that he is not into anything. He just likes vanilla sex, so I have no idea how to introduce any of my kinks and sexual fantasies in our bedroom.

As far as anal goes, we are taking it slow. Just really hard to get over being forced by someone in the past. He is taking care of me along the way and giving me support. He isn't making me go through with what he wants me to do. I want to, I am just nervous and scared of the pain and being triggered.","I [19M] am in a long time relationship with my boyfriend [19M] and I am having trouble getting to a comfortable spot in my sex life.

Thank you.","I'm a 19 year old male. I just got hired at a job. Because of a situation at home I have been having trouble getting to work twice. The first time was that my job didn't tell me where to look for my schedule or tell me a time. We'll, now it's the third time and I am freaking out. I don't know what to do right now. I am being sexually harassed and assaulted at home by mom and her boyfriend. I had suicidal thoughts and very high anxiety and I was struggling to keep myself from harming myself in any way. My boyfriend picked me up and took me to his place (30 minutes away from my house) in his roommates car. His car is very not safe to drive and I don't have a ride. I don't know how to explain to my boss what happened or what to even do. I am on limited time to get answers. I feel like I am going to get fired. I am so panicked.","I am [19M] and I don't know what to do. I want to move out, but if I do it would really screw over my mom. She cannot afford to move to another place and I feel super stuck here. I am FTM transgender. I am not getting any positive support from my family at all. My mom claims that she cannot work and it's really, really driving me crazy that I have to stay at home and around really narcissistic people. I get super, super drained everyday and it just makes me feel crazy. I have been recently questioning a lot of things like why her arthritis would hold her from working. There are jobs out there that she can get. I have a job myself and she claims that the government housing she is living in would make me pay rent. I have to hand the money to her and she will pay. She complains about not being rich and wants me to work while she stays home and does whatever. I don't really fit the job I currently have because the conditions aren't very great and I feel very uncomfortable with the people I work with. I want to move so I can get a better job, most likely go to school. My mom claims that she is tired of me living with her, but wants me to stay home because she says that housing will make her down grade to a smaller home since she lives with my brother. She has a boyfriend that stays here too, but he never explained his living situation to me. Her boyfriend is a pervert towards me, sexually assaulted me again today and my mom tells me to wear something else if I don't want him to look at me. (I still dress ""feminine"" for a guy, but I don't mind it. I wear mostly men's clothes anyway, but sometimes I will go with old clothes because I still need to go clothes shopping.. I am broke.) 

I don't feel safe here. It makes me sick to feel this way or to be told to change for her boyfriend to not stop the harassment. I still have my breasts and this time he came over and just looked down my shirt. I feel really gross, well, worse about my body than I should have to. My mom knows and encourages his actions. It's been like this since I was a kid and they were both just too into harassing me in such a manner; touching/groping my butt, or looking down my shirt. Even asking for me to pull down my pants and underwear to show them my penis. My mom got with her boyfriend when I was 15 and a half. I find it so shit because my mom and I would watch crime shows and this man had molested and assaulted kids, but his own daughter and then she comments on how evil his behaviors were. Her boyfriend did it to me and I almost said something about how ironic it was that she is letting it happen and yet she will not talk about it. I am just getting so sick of it. I just want to pack all my stuff up and go, but I can't because she will not let me. I don't know what to do. I don't want to spend the next 2-5 years putting up with bigotry and such a disgustingly stressful situation. Especially when I have a lot going on already. I was thinking about trying to contact my biological dad and seeing what's going on with him. 

Another note is that I will be going to spend time with my boyfriend and then I will be getting spammed with texts about when I am coming home after my mom tells me that I am an adult and I can do whatever. I also get told to do something and I don't care about what is, I will do it, but she just comes back a minute after and just keeps telling me over and over. I will tell her okay when I am cooking or eating. She comes back a second after, peaks her head over ""I thought I told you something, *missy*."" I would explain that I know, but I am hungry and I will get it done after. She gets pissy and I just want to stress out even more because she will keep going on about how I just woke up and I am being so lazy. Or I am not doing what she wants. I do it after, but not when I am cooking. I don't know what to do, let it burn?? She even told someone that she would call the cops if I transition. I want to see that happen. I don't like my mom or her boyfriend. I don't care if she gave birth to me. She isn't a real mother. I feel really alone in the house and I feel like she views me as nothing, but a childish embarrassment and a toy. I feel like a punching bag and sex doll. The boyfriend honestly needs his throat punched. I don't like where I am right now.","Congratulations that must feel so great! You might not know me, but I mean this from the bottom of my heart that I am so proud of you! You have a lovely day! I hope you receive more positive vibes and lots of love! ❤️😁","So, I am a 19 gay and transgender male. I grew up in a very closed minded family. I am currently dealing with a lot. Didn't know who else, but our community to give advice. I don't have a great therapist. I have a really bad one. I am not here to vent about that, but I am getting into a very dark space in my mind again, I have a history of sui cide. I don't know what else to say. I feel like am losing this battle of all it clashing together. I mostly stay at my boyfriend's place to hide from it all. I am being molested and sexually assaulted by my mom and her boyfriend. I have no proof of them doing this and it drives me crazy. They started doing this after I came out. It's making me feel super unsafe. My boyfriend knows, but cannot do anything about it. I stay in my room and besides that I go to work. I am dealing with grief over my grandfather who passed away a year ago and losing the only family member who loved me even when I came out because he didn't know anyway. He had dementia and a brain injury and I was very, very close to him because I had no father figure in my life besides him. I am conflicted with hating my mom, but having no other parent, I have an attachment to her anyway which is really damaging me really deeply. I can't move because it would result in my mom becoming homeless. She claims that she cannot work because she has arthritis in her arms, neck, finger, and back. She tells me that I am an adult, but talks down to me. I have to closet myself, dead name myself, and misgender myself to make my family happy and it's draining me. I have been dealing with a lot of anger and sadness because I don't want to celebrate anything this year because of Papa being gone. I just got to grieve because I dumped my ex and just got away without him killing me. He pretended to be gay for sex and turned around and started to beat on me. He even permanently injured my left shoulder. He popped my arm out of the socket and didn't put in back in until it was about 5 minutes.

I came home and my brother told me that he didn't ask for me to come back. My mom tells me to just get over being raped and she told me so. Her boyfriend tells me that I didn't get beat hard enough because I am still annoying. I am called fat for eating a burger after not eating for an entire day. I didn't want to come back because I knew they would be the same. My boyfriend treats me very well and I am super happy with who I am with, but my family is what is dragging me to the freaking depths. I want to get a new therapist, but there aren't really any that help LBGTQ individuals in Ohio. I honestly have no options. I have to stay ""home"" for my brother's sake of not being homeless or living with his pedo dad. I have a lot of history with my mom letting boyfriend's and her ex husband touch me and look at me as a kid to my early teens. The current boyfriend from my 16th birthday to my 19th birthday. I feel really nasty about myself. I have a lot of depression and a lot of issues about strangers touching me without me seeing them or knowing them. My brother's dad has raised me from infancy to my 13th birthday. My mom denies her boyfriend would do anything to harm me because he has a daughter of his own. Real smart thinking, I know. I really haven't had any change over these years. I came out 11 or so times and nothing. My family either ignores me or tells me that I am crazy. I feel really crazy. I've been just really close to having an emotional break down and don't know what to do or say anymore. I am breaking down slowly and I feel like I shouldn't have came out in the first place. Or that it's all my fault that they just hate me. Or that I am not a good kid for even being the way I am. I have days where I just love me don't get me wrong, but I don't have my family because of it and it's so painful to know that they would only care because I am saying that I am something I am not. I say anything about the LBGTQ and they are all over saying anything to make it seem bad. I am proud to be brave and be who I need to be, but it's hard to just always deal with it. It's really hard to hear my own mom say that she will call the cops to remove me off the property if I came around with a beard. It also hurts to be hated by someone society told you would keep you safe, but really just doesn't care. I feel like I did something wrong or didn't do enough. I don't know how to get away from that feeling. I don't know how to stand up to them and say, ""You know what? I am done"". I have, but I don't get them to listen. My mom and I did go through therapy and it didn't help us get any closer. Instead it made things worse for me. She eventually took me out of therapy and I did try to overdose because I couldn't take it in my freshman year. I didn't want to continue if this was just my life. It was very stressful and still is. No one sees through the curtain she throws over her personality. I talk about what happens and then my friends tell me how she is. That I am just lying and then she turns around and is the same person. It really puts me off. She acts nice, does some nice stuff and then she would turn around and tell me that I am a piece of shit and that I am just super embarrassing. 

I don't know. I hate it. I have issues with a lot of sexual stuff too that correlates with all the past and current issues I go through. My boyfriend and I have oral fine, but I am terrified of anal sex of any kind. My boyfriend and I talked about it, but I just keep getting PTSD episodes if he even goes near. I think I might be ready, but I don't know if I can even jump in or step into those new waters. I am a wreck, not to mention that I was also raped there by the ex many, many painful times. I could perform anal sex on myself, but I cannot let anyone else get near me without freaking out a lot.. Even by myself in my own bed is still pretty scary, but I manage. I can't go to my mom about it because she would again either ignore or mock me. She makes fun of rape a lot and I can't have her treat me like I wanted it to happen to me like she did when I came home. Sometimes still does. I wanted to throw out my blankets because it did and still does bring back sore memories of what I went through and when I mentioned this to her or even tried to myself, she told me to keep them for camping trips and sleep with them anyway. I have to get over it. This pissed my off because I feel really sore already and then she has to go on and tell me that what I am feeling doesn't matter. It's really tiring to deal with stress, depression, and try to act like nothing is wrong, but to end up being told that my feelings aren't valid. She would go through depression and then all of a sudden the whole world has to stop and take care of her mess while I work, while I do what I need to do, and try please them. I just don't understand it. I am too exhausted to.","So, I have a job as a cashier and I just got hired. I'm ftm and I'm unsure how to tell my manager without coming across as informal/unprofessional. I really don't want to be dead named or be called by the wrong pronouns since I'm out publicly. I could careless about what my family would think of me, but it's just important for me to know because I've asked about this before for people to tell me that they don't know or that I am on my own with this. I've taken classes to learn on the job and leadership skills only to get the same answer. I want to know your experiences with this and anything to watch out for. Obviously I can get let go, but it's a probability I won't since their against discrimination against gender identity.","I am currently job hunting and I went through classes to learn what to do in a job interview. Other stuff related to that. Well, I was the only transgender person there and had some trouble getting answers to questions related to what to do as a transgender in the work place. How to come out to your manager, how to deal with harassment, etc. I'm female to male by the way and 19. No one has really taught this stuff to me. I really don't know if what I should even do.

On another note, I know a girl who is seeing an old friend that went to my high school. We didn't talk much, but his girlfriend seems to have been interested in being friends with me. I go by Dustin now and I'm dead naming. She knows this and calls me he/him pronouns and by my preferred name to my face, but I got curious and asked her how she addresses me around her friends. It made me feel sick to find out that she calls me by the wrong pronouns and uses my birth name to other people in conversation to ""make sure there is no confusion"". I want to yell because she knows my feelings and how I am trying to keep my birth name to be obscured to those who know me as Dustin. I don't like what she's doing, she even told her neighbor that she kinda looks like me which also makes me feel like I can't pass. This girl really bothers me. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt and just say that she might not know better, but I just can't without feeling worse about her doing this because she knows. I want to work with her to not hurt her feelings, but also get her to stop this crap. It's bothering me.",I love the look on his face in that photo. He looks like a very goody cat. Like he just loves to play and do whatever a goofball cat does in his day/night. So cute. He looks like a funny cat.,"She just likes to play fetch. Right after she walked away, she played with the bottle cap. Then brought it back after a moment and just kept repeating that. She doesn't really bring her bottle caps as gifts. She was being super playful at 3 in the morning.","Your words of encouragement really help. I have a therapist, but not a good one so I'm on the hunt for a better one until I find the right person to work with me rather than around me. I need someone to actually listen and not try to repeat herself over and over when it's really not great advice. I have friends and I have my family (my boyfriend and a sister) to be there for me. Really not sure if I am pregnant. Still just stressed about the possibility. I am not on track for my transition, just trying to get on hormones. I know why I would be hormonal. It just causes a lot of dysphoria and it's just overwhelming. Since being with my boyfriend and spending more time with him I have really been having a lot of that anxiety, just here and there. Not too bad. I have been just absolutely wrecked by my dysphoria because when it comes back it's just 10x worse. I will put the baby first because I understand that kids have needs and it's important to care about them. I love kids and I love my supportive boyfriend because he makes me feel a lot better, but even then it just makes me feel like crap to have all this going on. On top of that having my mom's boyfriend being creepy towards me since I was 15. I really just feel like my safety is compromised because of them being really unsupportive of me and being creepy. If I am pregnant, I am going to move since I don't like what's happening. I want the best for my family.","Not a problem. I hope whatever is going on gets better for you. I am sorry to hear that you're not doing well, but I really do wish you the best.",Thank you. Your words of support really help. I really hope that you are doing well in these times as well.,"So, I'm going through a lot lately. It's been a mess for my anxiety and now I'm just at a really low point with my mental health. I'm a 19 year old ftm transgender. I'm just really stressed. I am going through a pregnancy scare which is causing just a tidal wave of dysphoria for me. My boyfriend is trying his best to be as supportive as possible because he really doesn't know what I am going through right now because for one he isn't trans and he doesn't have the reproductive system to give birth. He supports me through anything I go through and do on my own and around him as well. I'm just having a really hard time trying to deal with this and stress about my family not wanting to support me about coming out as transgender. We did use contraceptives, but we are worried that they failed and now we're on our way to being dads too soon. We want kids, but we never talked about when or how we were to have them. We discussed a bit about me giving birth, but we were still unsure. We have issues with our families and haven't told them about the possibility of them becoming grandparents yet, but we plan when we find out for sure. I am just kinda panicking at the moment. I have been secretly panicking for a while, but haven't expressed this until now. I do talk to my boyfriend about my overwhelming anxiety about this whole situation, but it's still not helping. I go to therapy, but my therapist doesn't seem to understand where I am coming from with this. I feel really icky about this whole thing..I don't have much support besides friends who really don't understand my problems either. I am planning on going to a doctor as well (so don't worry about that.) I am just feeling dysphoric about having to see a doctor and possibly being misgendered or having problems. On top of that having risks of getting hurt or harassed by people. I don't know what to do either. I have friends who are willing to help me with the baby, but I don't know about my family who already abuse me and hurt me all the time. If I am with child I will pack up and move since it's for the safety of my baby and me. I just don't know where I am going to go. Another issue is that my mom would be homeless if I do go. I feel badly, but I don't know what else to do. She's on a housing program and she is to live in a three bedroom house since I am still under her roof. When I leave she has to move to a two bedroom house. She lives with my brother who is 14 years of age. I am just torn right now. I don't like my mom, but I don't want to hurt her or my brother either just because of something I really tried to prevent. It really bothers me.",Thank you for the explanation. It was very helpful.,"I have a dairy allergy, but I eat other things as well. What is a flexitarian by the way?","I get the whole ""We don't have dairy free, but we do have gluten free. Will that work?"" No, because gluten and dairy aren't the same. I also hate that employee's at a fast food chain or restaurant don't know what items contain dairy or if they cross contaminate their food. I also hate that they don't have an allergy menu. I call and ask about food with a new restaurant and they never know about their food. I really think that people should be taught what is dairy and what isn't. People could die if they make a mistake. My family and I went to a restaurant that had everything either cooked in butter or made with some kind of dairy product. I asked for my meal to be dairy free and told them that I am allergic and I got my meal covered in butter. It was melted in the other food on the plate as well, so I asked them to remake it. The waitress told me it was dairy free and I about yelled because it was Father's day and I was grieving. I just asked her to send it back. She told me to remove the chicken because it didn't have butter, but I had to explain cross contamination to her. She took it back after trying to argue with me about what dairy is and butter isn't dairy.","I have seen an LBGTQ therapist, but I have no idea where to go and how to see her. I did talk a little bit with her, but my mom made me stop seeing her. This was when I first came out. I really need to start looking. Just don't know where to go and how to get there.","So, I'm a 19-year-old ftm and I'm having some issues with my therapist. The office I go through doesn't know how to deal with LBGTQ issues. I talk to her and she doesn't seem to listen to me. I'm struggling with my family no longer being my support since I came out to them. I've also had more issues when I was a little older being molested by my mom's boyfriend. She even knew and asked him to be inappropriate towards me as a minor and more. I really don't want a relationship with her, but I've tried to make my feelings clear to her about my depression and the way she treats me. Anytime I mention being trans or anything she doesn't like to read/hear she just ignores me. She puts me aside. My mom and I don't have a relationship with each other. I stated that to my therapist and she just keeps saying that I need to stop trying to force a relationship with my mom and just learn to let go when I have. I stopped writing the letters a while ago and I've stopped hanging around at home. I can't move yet, but my therapist keeps going back and tell me that she hopes to get me to a point where I can fix the relationship between me and my mom. I am getting annoyed because she knows what's going on and that she's letting her boyfriend do some inappropriate stuff to me and she's letting him be verbally abusive towards me for no reason.

I'm also annoyed because she doesn't understand what I'm talking about when I mention anything about how I feel about my gender. It's really frustrating that I spend time talking with someone who is paid to talk to me about why I might feel the way I do. I understand that she might not understand because she herself is not trans or trained to deal with transgender problems, but I want to be understood. I'm try to make sense. Even if I explain what I am saying to her, it seems like she isn't listening to me. We would talk to each other in an entire session and then the next session I have to repeat. I feel like a broken record. It's stressful. I have no access to LBGTQ therapists that will accept my insurance and I'm at a loss. I want to switch so I don't have to feel worse than I did before the therapy session. I want someone who would understand. I just want a little help. I can talk more about this, just ask me for more information if it is needed. I have a lot of stress these days.",Really made my day. Cute cat. I have never seen a cat that sleeps on their face until now. Love this so much. Thanks for sharing! 😋❤️,"I would do the same thing. I love this so much. So much love, support, and devotion for someone like that goes a long way. I love the relationship these sisters have for each other. I would do anything for a sibling like that. It's so beautiful and about made me cry today.","Aww, that's sweet. I needed a hug today. Thank you fluffy. I hope someone returns the favor someday.",Yep. I feel that one right now. I get it all the freaking time. I hate it.,"I am a man. I stated that first hand. I have a boyfriend who found a place to rent and I'm moving in with him. I told my mom about it and she asked my what I would do about food and I just told her it was non of her concern really. She scoffed of course. I did move out once and tried zero contact, but my ex beat me up and raped me. I stayed as long as I could until the guy almost killed me and then I had my mom come get me when she started telling me that she knew he would beat me up. She didn't know why and the guy wasn't even gay, but only wanted one thing. I didn't even like him. Only thought I did and I realized that too late in the relationship when his mental state got worse. I'm dealing with PTSD and all my family does is actually trigger that. Permanent reminders of all the things I went through, so I know I have to leave. I'm glad you did give me advice, but telling me it's okay to kill myself is better than here doesn't really make me feel great. Especially when I am suicidal. The only thing is that they would make it about themselves if I go through with taking my own life. I do want to sometimes, but I'm trying not to for my boyfriend. He just proposed to me and I really don't want him to feel like it was him or he wasn't good enough. I get strong feelings of wanting to die here. Like I knew I would eventually feel since coming back in January. I really hate these feelings, but it's them and the depression. They make it all worse. Then pretend to not have any part in it at all. I have to tell her that I am moving anyway so my brother isn't homeless. They're on government housing and if I am out of the house, then they have to move to a two bedroom house. That takes a while and she loses food stamps. I have to get on food stamps and get on insurance so I can do all these things very soon.","So, I'm 19 female to male and I've had issues with my mom and her boyfriend. I really don't understand why he gives the issues he does, but lately I've been feeling worse and worse. I have depression and anxiety and all of that has just been pounding on me. I've been trying to defend myself for many years, but it's getting worse. So I've been wanting to just tell my mom and her boyfriend to shove it. I just can't anymore. Her boyfriend touches my ass and calls me sexy. He even kissed me a few times when I was a minor and I still feel messed up he is just creepy towards me and I'm having issues with them being assholes. I have been trying to be nice about them being the way they are to me. Writing letters to my mom because I have issues discussing things face to face with her most of the time. I am planning on moving soon and I feel horrible about cutting all contact because I'm just hurt all the time. I know I'm going to feel better in the long run, but I just don't feel good. I am miserable honestly. My mental health is back to being dangerously low and I'm scared of her boyfriend. I am scared to even say anything about him using the wrong name or pronouns, him touching me. Or doing anything to me. My mom knows about her boyfriend being this way to me and it really sucks. I try to do something on my own and my mom will say okay, then turn around and say no. I am getting really tired and dizzy from all of this. I have demanded her to call me by my name because eventually I am going to be on my own and I will be living my own life. I don't know if she should talk to my therapist about all of this because I'm not getting through to her. Her boyfriend won't listen to me either and she wants to marry this guy.

I'm just feeling like a terrible son. I at one point did call CPS when I was 17, but they didn't do anything to help me because I was 18 in three months. They just came out, talked my mom and the reason that she said he was innocent was because he had a daughter and he said he would never do that to me. She watched this happen to me and let it happen because I'm not ""normal."" I feel gross now. She did the same thing when her ex husband touched me and she said that daddies do that to show their love. I had an eating disorder after a while because I was made fun of for being fat (which I wasn't) so I just ended up slowly starving myself. She calls me fat even though she knows that I went through all that. She even let's her boyfriend call me fat after I eat one thing even if that was the first thing I ate all day. He tells me to watch my weight or my boyfriend would leave me. I tried to say that he wouldn't, but he just laughed and told me to watch it happen to me anyway. My mom just keeps telling me that love isn't unconditional. I'm having really messed up thoughts lately. That I'm either fat or that I am better off dead. I don't know what to say or do at this point. It's all abuse. There's just so much I can take and I can't take that much. I'm afraid that he would hit me or that he would touch me more. I don't know how they would act out if I start telling him what I want from them. I am going to start hormones and once my voice starts dropping they might do something then. I want to be freer than I am. I am wearing clothes I want, but my mom is trying to push gender roles on me again. Then she will buy girl's clothes for me. Especially when it's my birthday. She just keeps making things worse for me. I feel like shaving my head or just screaming at them. No one here listens to me. I try and then they pretend like everything with me is okay. My mom even told me that she doesn't think I would kill myself, but I have tried before and even that she puts aside. I feel like I want to die and I just don't want to hurt anyone. I don't want to hurt myself. I am so tired all the time. She argues that she just doesn't want to agree with me and I'm just angry. I keep having panic attack dreams about her. They're so stressful. I told her, but she just laughs at me. Any advice would be nice. Thank you."
TylorNgo,"So, I have been sinking deep in the world of major depression for 10+ years, been trying to suicide 4+ times, got into behavioral hospitals twice, and was just on the correct med for the past 10 months.

I yearned for helps. Apparently, the past 2 relationships haven't been all that good due to the ex not being able to fully grasp what it feels like being depressed. They do indeed, love me, but the way they express their love is kinda too weak to bring me out of the shell, or too strong that it kinda shames me in some ways and make me feel even more useless.

I broke up with the second girl last year.

Well, I have been on and off of Tinder since March. Last month I matched with this girl, chat a bit, see something clicked. I notified her that I have depression, and a serious one. I want her to be prepared, and if she deems to not be able to handle it, we can stop soon and not wasting each other's time.

Yesterday, she told me she loves me, due to the fact that I have been trying my best during the past 10+ years, which prove my strength.

She told me she had just done some deep research on the case the past week, and had been thinking about it seriously, and she wanted to help me.

She also told me that, from how I chat with her, that I seem to be a decent guy, and when all of our interests, hobby, and habit, clicked almost perfectly, she wanted to give it a shot, and wanted me to do the same.

For the first time in my life, there is a lady that see past the mental illness of me, and is trying to look through it. It's as if she is trying to pull out the perfect man that has been shelled off way too long due to the illness just because nobody seems to even try their best to understand.

So yeah, she said she loved me. My heart skipped a beat. Got panic attack due to excitement last night. It was the happiest moment in my life, as I feel I am eventually someone, not just ""no-one.""

Guys, try your best. There will always be a person out there, a friend, a woman, a man, or just some random strangers out there, that can understand your true worthiness. Don't give up.

So the position I am applying to says that it's stock option only for the first 2 months, then salaried later.

But currently Personal Branding revolves around emphasising on memes and stuff.

I mean not everyone can build the personal brand giving same advice about happiness and business stuff ryt?

Like you could become someone very cool like Elon Musk.

That guy touches the hearts of youngsters but makes Boomers think he is doing nonsense shit .

What is the Ideal Personal Brand someone can have.

I mean After all we want conglomerates to work with us or maybe Get a job under them."

Mail still seems to be flowing btw","So I am new to administering Exchange, and was tasked with migrating from Exchange 2003 to 2013.  The move from 2003 to 2010 was a real pain but I finished and gave some settling time on 2010.  When I started the migration to Exchange 2013 on a server 2012R2 VM, I made sure it was as up to date as possible, and everything seemed to be going fairly smoothly, until the mailbox migration stopped and I realized the virtual drive I had created was full, (I didn't realize the logs would take up as much space as they did), so I shutdown increased the virtual drive size, booted up logged in and increase drive size in the disk management, and rebooted once more.  I believe this was the same time that the EAC quit working, I was able to finish the migration in Powershell, and everything seems to be working fine now including the inter OWA, but when I pull up the EAC page it brings up the login, but then goes 500 Unexpected Error :(, I have tried everything I can find, recreating Virtual Directories, clearing the Canary values in ASDIEdit, and multiple other things but nothing is working, also I have noticed the following error in my application log and feel like it maybe the root of the problem but can't seem to find much about it

I guess to summarize what I am going through, a combination of a loss in my family and general uncertainty over both my future and the state of the world have left me feeling down as of recent. Beginning rather recent, I have been having constant thoughts over the concept of mortality, abnormally low energy than usual, and a mild, albeit persistent irritation in both my chest and my head. As of now, I am taking steps be more sociable and productive to counteract this, but if anyone has any advice as to how alleviate these symptoms, reach brighter disposition, or just even offer up positive encouragement, I would be more than happy to read it.

I used to be a right libertarian myself. I largely drifted away from the ideology as I studied more of history and bore witness to the rise of a populist, illiberal faction of the GOP to political power, something that my libertarian values were in contrast to. I am currently a left-libertarian as of now. I personally think democratic socialism would work in the United States as most, if not all Americans have little say in our economic processes, and whose financial security net is left largely at the mercy of a betting market. 

Something many people, even some socialists, seem to forget is that socialism at its core is not state ownership of the means of production but rather the democratization of the economy and workplace. Rather than industries being dominated by an unelected board of shareholders who consolidate wealth, companies are run by the workers for the workers. In an era where wealth inequality is at an all time high, I’d say that pursing such economic systems is a necessity to prevent America from becoming the third world nation it is slowly turning into. 

Granted, Biden isn’t the man to do it. His economic mode is largely stuck in the same third-way rut that most establishment Dems have stuck with since Clinton, and with Mitch and the courts poised to shoot him down at every turn, it’s highly unlikely that any substantial change will occur under Biden. So if you still decide to stick with your right-libertarian principles, don’t fret. A Biden administration is far from the end of the world.

sammy_702,Sending love to you and Gretsch.,"I got some melatonin (Natrol 5mg, I believe) from Walmart and that really helps. I found a few good ambient playlists on Spotify that help to knock me out.","I’m on Lexapro (20mg) and I have attacks after taking it sometimes. The right medication can make a huge difference. It’s trial and error. Medication doesn’t completely prevent it, but it does make it more manageable.","Sending hugs. I do believe in medication bc being on Lexapro really helped me to manage things. Medication is hit-or-miss, but the right one can make a huge difference. Deep breathing helps me too. Try taking a deep breath, holding it for 5-8 seconds, then slowly exhaling until your heart rate goes down. Sleep helps a lot. Ambient music, maybe? I found some good ambient playlists on Spotify that help me focus and fall asleep, along with taking melatonin. And you got this!",I struggle with my appearance all the time. I hate it. Just know that nothing about you is ugly or shameful. It’s so hard to love your body. I don’t want you to let dickheads dictate how you feel about yourself (I used to get bullied and I let it consume me.) I hope this helps you.,"I have this too. I want to say this sounds perfectly normal to me bc anxiety/tension causes you to experience that. But it’s best to get it checked out if you can. Talking to my doctor has given me some peace of mind. Going for walks (anything that helps strengthen your heart) helps. I’ve been walking about 2-3 miles a day and practicing deep breathing. It seems to help in general. Try taking a deep breath, hold it for about 5-8 seconds, then breathe out slowly until your heart calms down. It has helped my shortness of breath. Get plenty of rest and stay hydrated bc that helps circulation, I believe. Hopefully this helps you in some way.","Honestly, I’m relieved I only have to work 4 days/week (my hours were reduced due to everything going on.) When I don’t have to work, I feel less stressed. But my job is easy. Having a break from responsibilities is nice. I’m dreading going back to full-time, but I feel ashamed bc so many people are unemployed.

While I love them, it annoys me to no end how selfish they can be at times.","Brenda’s role in The Fever Code was refreshing to me. I admit, Teresa’s storyline was confusing to me when I first read the books. It was confusing for me to tell whether or not Teresa had her memories and where.",True,I agree!,"When I read the books, I hated her. But now I kinda like her. She was pretty cool. A lot of people seem to dislike her. I’d love to hear your opinions.","I believe Teresa was heavily brainwashed by WCKD. I didn’t actually dislike her character. I liked how the movie showed her finding the cure because it showed what she believed in. But I do believe she shouldn’t have trusted WCKD with it. After all that was done to them, I agreed with Thomas on that.","I don’t understand how she could still trust WCKD after seeing everything Thomas had. Remember in the books/movies when she explained to Thomas what had happened to her mother and that there were so many others suffering, with stories like hers? I feel like she had good intentions. But (especially in the second movie) she endangered a lot of people. Even she lied to Thomas for “the greater good.” My feelings about her death are mixed, but it was still sad for me.","WCKD brainwashed, tortured and manipulated those kids and, imo, possibly their employees. The idea of an organization for finding a cure is great and all, but let’s not forget they killed in innocent people and ripped children from their homes. They treated the immunes like they were disposable. In The Fever Code, there was George’s death and everything Dr. Paige did in the end. So many lies. And I found it interesting how Thomas had his memories erased and put into the Maze the way he was, right when he was really starting to learn the truth about what was going on. I also feel like they crossed lines as far as the kids’ privacy. I mean, how scary is the idea of having a chip put in you w/out say that can do all that? It really bothered me reading about how they tortured Minho when he tried to escape. Also, forcing Thomas and his friends to watch?! Nothing about their methods in these books were trustworthy. I agree with the other comments, that they should have also focused on stopping the spread. WCKD could have saved so many lives. In conclusion, I’d say, no, WCKD is not good. I have so much more faith in Thomas and his friends.","Okay! Great, thanks!","Not a YouTuber, but I HATE those ASMR vids where people chew/eat/drink into the mic. And James Charles.

He overcame his addiction and struggles, and that part of him that was drawn to darker things. Despite his mistakes, he taught me to keep fighting. I always thought he was more open. The way he is with other people (whether or not they made him more of a support character) was something I always loved about him. I’ve always been the kind of person who digs deeply into lore and occult research, too. His sense of humor and personality in general is more of what I’m drawn to. But I always thought he was so strong.",YES! The only thing that seems to help is stretching my legs (touching my toes while sitting with my legs straight) and massaging my legs. I hate it.,"Same thing goes through my mind! It sucks! I’m sorry you’re dealing with panic attacks. I’m on Lexapro and I take melatonin (5mg) before bed every night. Just found out I might have SVT (a heart condition where your heart rate gets high) so that made my anxiety worse, but taking the meds helps keep my heart rate down somewhat. The melatonin really helps me sleep. Before I started it, I would be up for hours bc of my anxiety.","I agree that they were all (in a way) shitty. At least Jess and Logan challenged Rory. IMO, Dean was the worst. Between his constant clinginess and the entire situation with Lindsay, his character went downhill FAST. He was abusive. I loved him at first and I wish I could say I love him now. I have to rant about Logan... I cannot stand how he kept having affairs. He came across as entitled and snobby—how he treated Jess was so unnecessary. While he had his good moments, I don’t like Logan. Although, at least Logan showed up for Rory most of the time. I think Rory and Logan were most alike. I think Jess’ behavior was understandable, given his childhood. It makes sense to me why he’d have commitment or communication issues. I also think that his time with Rory shaped their characters. Sometimes, you need to date a “Jess” to understand what you deserve or don’t want in a relationship. He was definitely flaky, but I liked him the most. Finally, I agree that it seems like Dean was bitter towards Luke for being able to stay with the Lorelais.","Omg! You are freaking gorgeous!

","For instance I really can't help but judge people that think 50 shades of Grey is a good book, same with Twilight. To me beach reads should still be written well and I find it depressing how successful these books are.  It really worries me when people think well written literature is boring and that people that prefer books that are written well and have good characters as elitists.  Back in the 90s it seemed like novels like 50 Shades and Twillight were regulated to Harlequins and Silhouettes and people actually respected books that were at least well written.  Or maybe I am looking at the past with rose tinted glasses.   What other books do you feel do not deserve their success? Do you think books can be objectively bad or good?","Climate Change causing super storms and rising oceans, or Nuclear War."

fishcakers01,"Psychiatrist prescribed me Fluoxetine (Prozac/Fluorex) 20 mg for the first time to treat depression, but I am too scared to take it.

marvel_freak_,"so tired of everything going on right now. tired of online schooling, tired of drifting away from my only 2 friends, tired of having to go through the same menial shit every single fucking day. tired of all the protests and noise. i understand why people are upset and they have every right to be. i’m upset too. but burning a whole building down? it makes all the peaceful protesters look bad. i have nothing against peaceful protesting (except that there’s a worldwide pandemic but whatever i guess). and now they’re calling in police and military officers. things are just getting out of hand in my opinion..

i’m sorry if this seems like “oo i’m an edgy teen and i’m sooooo depressed give me attention” but those kinds of people piss me off more than anything and it’s the last thing i want to be called.

i’m just so angry all the time about the smallest things.

all the stupid people in the world, people who think they’re doing good but are only making things worse for themselves and everyone around them. those anti-social distancing protests before the George Floyd ones. “covid-19 is a LIE!!” “vaccines cause autism!!” “covid-19 is just the flu!” “covid-19 was manufactured by the Chinese government!!”

they’re all BRAINDEAD. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. what I DON’T understand is why the news is putting out articles titled something like “protest happens and now one of the attendees has coronavirus!!” yeah, NO SHIT there are gonna be cases, there’s hundreds and hundreds of people at those protests. can you put out something important please?

the california beaches where again, hundreds and hundreds of people are gathering. nothing good is going to come out of that. why can’t people just be patient for once and not scream “I’M OPPRESSED I’M OPPRESSED” when we’re in quarantine to save other peoples’ lives. to keep people on the front lines from going home and breaking down from all the stress they’re under. to keep our kids healthy. ffs.

i’m struggling with my own problems. self harm, depression, anxiety disorders. to me they’re just an added weight on my shoulders. i’ve struggled with anxiety since the fourth grade and depression since the fifth. sometimes it feels like all the therapists I ever talk to don’t really get it. and I KNOW that sounds a lot like “nOBody UndeRsTands mE” but often I feel like that’s really the case. i feel like a burden on every person I interact with just because they talked to me in the first place. someone once said to me they liked my glasses and it took me about five seconds to respond with a “thank you” and then I broke down on the bus because I hated the way my voice sounded (I’m a transgender male, not yet transsexual). i have a loving family and i feel so fucking bad that they have to spend hundreds of dollars on me just to go to therapy. i don’t want them to waste their money on me.

sometimes i just want to end it all. to not have to worry about anything anymore. to be free from all of this anger. i just don’t know what to do.","I bleeped the word because I’m not sure if it could trigger anyone or not, just want to be safe. I don’t mean any offense to anyone in this post.

Obviously I would understand if you were called a tr*nny and you were offended by it, that’s totally understandable. But why is it such a bad thing of a trans person calls THEMSELVES a tr*nny? Or God forbid, say it at all? As long as they aren’t targeting it at anybody (but themselves for comedic purposes or something), what’s the problem with it? I’ve seen people get bombarded with hate comments such as “you can’t say the t word!!” “you’re so transphobic, you said the t word!” and it’s honestly just so confusing to me. If anyone can enlighten me, please do. I would appreciate it."
Doomfollow,"I've thought about killing myself for as long as I can remember. I held a gun in my mouth when I was 15 years old. When my dad found out his only concern was how I got ahold of his guns. He did not care about my mental health, his only care was how it was not possible for me to get ahold of his guns, and that I was doing this all for attention.

Fast foward until I graduate high school and get to move away to go to University. I had the best year of my life until COVID hit, and I'm forced to move back in with my parents and do all my schooling online. Ever since I've been back I can't even smile. I hate it here more than anything.

Suhern,"Hello I was wondering if anyone one would like to share any tips or experiences when dealing with a depressed family member. 

I find that it makes my own recovery so much harder... where what I really need is some positivity at home.

For some personal context:
- been diagnosed with OCD for 5 years got severely depressed along the way
- suffer significantly from being the only child and acting as a parentified child
- my depressed father suffers from emotional immaturity due to being abandoned as a child 
- I am the hyper responsible one who feels guilty when not helping my loved ones 
- currently my situation got worse as I had to further delay my education significantly due to my illness. This is a severe blow to my dad as he cannot contend with his own desires being squashed. Unknowingly being very selfish as he has turned the whole situation about himself rather than me who is dire need of support

mixednuts333,"I’m a CNA at a long term care nursing home, I get people dressed, I feed them, brush their teeth, shower them etc. Recently 13 residents have become Covid positive and are on complete lockdown. I’ve already lost so many residents this year from declined mental states from being on isolation or not being able to see their family’s and today it hit me hard it hit me really hard. My facility has in place a policy that windows cannot be opened on family visits so that family’s cannot spread the virus to residents, today a family brough their new baby to see a resident and the resident asked me to open the window so she could see her great grandson. She told me how all she wanted to do was hold him and kiss him and meet her grandson and the only thing I could do is tell her she can’t lest i lose my job. I had to stand there and listen to the family yelling at me through the window that I’m heartless and that I don’t care and that I have no compassion. And now every time I go into that room I have to look in the eyes of someone who I care deeply about but who I also was forced to emotionally hurt. That’s just on example I  can’t describe to you the pain I see people go through every day, I get to go home and Hug my family and my kids I get to eat where I want and I get to do what I want.

mayoxox,"It's already September. High school has started, new conditions, new people and new experiences, yet my feelings stay the same. The wish of not being alive still remains inside me and never leaves my body. Even at times when I feel some sparkles of joy, it's always there with me. 

I question myself - *Will I ever be free from this infinite nightmare?* It's become a world that I live in, filled with nothing but fog and blackness. But then, I remind myself, that there's no hope left in me, because I always end up letting myself down.

I'm just getting weaker with each second. I don't want to sleep, because the knowledge of me waking up again and starting a new, but still hopeless and dark day, makes me feel nauseous. 

Funny how I can just kill myself in any second I desire to. It can be done without any thought made before it, any consideration, without any consent from anyone. And if I crave for it so much, then why can’t I bring myself to do it? I'm so desperate for death, for the appealing idea of me not being alive anymore.  

It's so beautiful, yet so morbid at the same time.  

Therefore, that is what keeps me trapped in this loop of helplessness.

kilted-vagabond,"Like, my life isn't total shit. I'm a somewhat poor college student but my family is supportive and would be willing to help me out if things tanked financially. I don't have that many close friends, but I'm an introvert who doesn't have much of a desire to go out and make more friends. But despite the fact that I'm meeting my basic needs, I still feel so depressed.

I just feel like life is almost entirely a painfully monotonous crawl towards death with the occasional exceptional good or bad experiences strewn along the path. I've got around a year of college left, and then it's off to be a wage slave for the rest of my life. Sure, I'll have some good times and some bad times along the way, but most of the time will be spent in dull, crushing monotony. We're all going to die anyway, so why not avoid the monotony and just get it over with now? 

But dying sounds pretty painful, whether it's by suicide or not. I can't get a gun and if I fail I would regret it. One of my previous roommates hung himself, and I don't want my current roommate and my family to go through what I had to go through. I doubt I could get my hands on any drugs that I could overdose on, plus a lot of deaths by overdose sound painful. Cutting, drowning, electrocution, jumping in front of a train or off a bridge sound really painful. Plus I don't want whoever finds my body to be traumatized, so it looks like I'm stuck living.

I feel like life is a drug that gives you extreme highs every once in a while, extreme lows once in a while, and is just kind of boring for most of the experience. Plus by the end of the day it'll kill you. I wouldn't do heroin myself, and I wouldn't get a baby hooked on crack. Why would I want to keep on living? I guess for the same reason a junkie keeps shooting up: I'm afraid of the comedown.","Strange, I never remember eating depression","I'm pretty sure the phrase is ""if your right hand offends you, you should choose not to be offended"" smh /s","You can check out the online BYU Survival Guide.

Which route would you suggest for a beginner hitchhiker, or is there an even better way to get to Cali?

&#x200B;

Route 1: Take I-80 out from SLC through Elko and Reno into Sacramento. I've got a friend in SLC who could get me a ride out to the interstate. Seems nice to me, but I'm a bit worried about how far out the towns along this route are spaced.

&#x200B;

Route 2: Take a train up to Ogden and then follow the I-84 out through Idaho into Oregon, and then head back down to Cali. I wouldn't mind this path, as I'm planning on stopping by Oregon and Washington some time this summer.

&#x200B;

Route 3: Get a bus ticket to Las Vegas, and then take the I-15 into South California. I could do this, but I'd rather stay north where the weather will be cooler. Plus, I'd rather not have to pay for a bus ticket if I don't have to.","I've been thinking about doing a really similar trip this summer, but I'll be focusing more on the Pacific Northwest.",r/dankchristianmemes,You could also take the Frontrunner up to Ogden.

When you said “I am a sexual little” my brain just automatically blew up on you because I thought you were trying to say that it’s perfectly fine to be sexual while regressed and you were mistaking age play for regression.","I probably shouldn’t have blown up on you, and I’m sorry for that. I really don’t care anything about age play, it just gets to be a problem when people intertwine regression with age play. I know genuine regressors that use it as a coping mechanism but when they first got into it all they could find was sexual content titled “regression” and that’s extremely harmful to regressors, under 18 or over 18. I don’t care what adults do in their private life, they just need to stop mistaking it for regression.","Some regressors aren’t adults, I’d say a good chunk of the community is under the age of 18. I don’t like it, but I don’t really care if you’re into age play as long as you’re not calling it regression, it’s not. Age play is acting/roleplaying, and it’s a kink, not a coping mechanism. Calling it regression is harmful to actual regressors.","First of all, breastfeeding isn’t sexual all the time, is it sexual when infants do it? No. I’m definitely not sorry, but sexual regression is extremely invalid and pedophilic. That is a kink, and it’s disgusting. You have no place in a safe space for actual regressors. You’re doing it for a kink. You disgust me. We’re already trying to fight the notion that regression is sexual, and you’re definitely not helping. Get help, you’re sick.","I never said that you couldn’t have a sexual life outside of regression. I’m saying you should NEVER (You can say never sometimes) bring sexuality into littlespace or age regression. My sexual trauma is one of the reasons I use littlespace, and it angers me to no end when people say age regressors can be sexual while regressed.","Age regression is never sexual, including impure regression.","Impure regression has nothing to do with being sexual, anyone who thinks otherwise is misinformed and harmful. Impure regression is basically involuntarily slipping into littlespace to protect yourself from something. Impure regression could be involuntarily slipping into little space while you’re having a panic attack to protect yourself, or getting all your frustration/anger/anxiety out through a tantrum while you’re in little space. 
There’s nothing wrong with impure regression, and it can definitely help you, but if it gets too much there’s things you can do to prevent it. You can make time for littlespace when you get the opportunity to be alone. Set up your stuffies, grab a snack, watch some cartoons or anything that makes you feel small. Personally I like to make a little cocoon on my bed with blankets and pillows, it makes me feel safe. Another trick is that you can write/draw/color with your less dominant hand (if you’re right handed do it with your left hand and vice versa) it makes you feel like a child.

But I continue to eat, eat, eat. I don't know what to do. I know what is normal but I don't know how to achieve that in my mind.","I also have this fear, even before the incident happened. Made it scarier when it actually happened.","Well, yes.","This was about 4/5 years ago when I was around 19-20 years old. I lived in a small house on a plot of land in a nice neighborhood (albeit a sketchy city,) with two other houses on it: one beside me and one right behind me.

On one particular evening I was relaxing in the living room watching YouTube videos. My roommate and her dog were out of town, as was my boyfriend at the time, so I had the place to myself. It was during the summer so I had all windows open to let the breeze in. These were older windows withno screens, sowe would use expandable screens thatrested in the frame of the window, held in place by the window pane resting ontop of it.

Anyway, I was sitting with my face maybe 1 foot away from an open window, which doesn't mean anything but becomes a creepy thought after what happened next.

I decided to get something out of my room, and as I walked in I could see what I thought to be a man's face looking through my bedroom window, directly at me. I couldn't decide if this was real or not and the only thing I could say was, ""Uhhhhh..."" After I said that, still staring right at the window, the man's face slowly moved away from the window still staring at me the whole time he moved. 

What really creeps me out is how slowly he moved away from the window, like he didn't even care that I had seen him.
Frightened, I ran around the house closing and locking all doors and windows. I grabbed the biggest knife in my kitchen and (stupidly) went outside and called out ""Hello??""

I saw a man walk past my house and looking back on the experience, it was the one looking through my window. This all happened very late at night with no one else around. I slept with the knife that night. 

The man was actually caught not too long after this incident, for looking into my under-aged neighbor girls' windows. So, if there's any chance whatsoever, creepy window man... let's not meet.",My breasts. One of my favorite parts about being skinny was tiny boobs; I could wear whatever I wanted and look good in my opinion,"Well, not exactly ""okay"" with it. But, I haven't had any money for food lately. So I've been eating one meal a day at work, which is a restaurant (my meal is 1/2 off and taken out of my tips at the end of the day.) 

I'm walking everywhere because there's no gas in my car, I can't afford to put any in there.

And yet I still manage to mess up a little. Yesterday I had 16 French fries with 1 oz of ranch dressing, 5 oz of s chocolate milkshake, 1/2 of a 5 layer burrito from Taco Bell (my friend didn't want to eat it), and a big ol' spinach salad with salmon on it. I feel the worst about the fries >.<

Anyway, not much else to say, just wanted to shout this out to the ether and get it off my chest."
KindOfLikesLeaves,"Like the title says. I literally just cannot take it some days. The depression and anxiety control every part of my life. Slowly but repeatedly eating away more and more of any tiny ounce of happiness I have left. I just want to go to sleep.  

And I feel so guilty because objectively things aren’t that bad for me. I’ve made it to medical school and I haven’t failed out of that yet. But my personal life and my relationships with people have just crumbled around me. And no I have no one. 

And it at night when all of these thoughts just start spinning around in my head and I just need them to STOP. LIKE PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST STOP. Give me one minute to breathe and feel ok. But it just keeps going and I’m exhausted and now I am begging to fall asleep but the tears keep coming and I can’t shut them off. 

Please someone, I just need some advice. Please. How can I just pull it together enough to sleep. I really really just need to sleep.",This sounds incredibly uncomfortable and im so sorry it’s happening to you. I would recommend seeing your primary care provider or obgyn about this. Vaginas are really sensitive and I would be hesitant to use anything without talking to a doctor first.,To be honest it is really hard to tell much from these pictures. I would recommend going to see your primary care provider or a dermatologist to have a physician look at this in person (or on a virtual visit because COVID) if you are concerned about it.,"It seems unlikely to me that it would be related to a puncture or complication from an upper endoscopy, particularly if it happened 7 months ago. It sounds like you were diagnosed with GERD or acid reflux based on your endoscopy. Is the pain similar to that or different?",It might help if you would be able to post a picture?,Why do you think the sperm came out of your anus?,Can you explain what you mean by your sternum sticking out? Are you having pain with swallowing?,I’m sorry if this is a dumb question but what would be the difference in how I would interpret the results of a regression vs a Kruskal-Wallis. If the kruskal-Wallis is similar to ANOVA then I’d be reporting differences in whatever groupings I chose. What would I be able to say about a regression? I’m wondering if the regression might be what I’m looking for but I’m not entirely sure how I would interpret the output of that test if that makes sense. And thank you for answering all my questions! I genuinely really appreciate it. This is so helpful and I’ve been doing this project kind of on my own and all I know about stats I learned in a college intro to stats class like 5 years ago.,"So I think this is part of my problem. I think I can do it either way. I can have low risk vs high risk alcohol and drug use vs no drug use be my groups (IV) and then look at differences in depression/anxiety scores (DV). And those scores can be either numerical, or categorical. If I use the actual scores on the depression/anxiety questionnaires then I was thinking I could do Kruskal-Wallis median tests. 

Or I can divide it up differently and have my IV be depression/anxiety vs no depression/anxiety and see if there is a difference in the number of people using drugs and having high risk alcohol use between those two groups. In this case I would be looking at two categorical variables and then I think i would maybe need either a Mann-Whitney u test (but I’m not sure if this is right) vs a nonparametric chi square. 

Ideally I think I want to answer the question of whether or not anxiety and depression cause increased use of drugs and alcohol (but both of these are just yes/no categories) and I’m not sure what test is going to be most appropriate for that. 

I know I can’t say causality since my study is cross sectional and not longitudinal so I’m just getting a little confused with all of these options.",Can I still use that if my data is significantly skewed?,I think the browning on the tips of old leaves and falling off is normal but the browning of new leaves is a sign something is wrong could. I wish I had a better answer for you but I’m not sure why new leaves would be browning. I’d guess it could be overwatering but it seems unlikely given you’ve only watered it once and just got it. I’m sorry. I wish I had better advice. It’s so frustrating when plants won’t cooperate.,"Hi! I'm a medical student working on a project looking at student mental health and substance abuse. Unfortunately with COVID its become really challenging to get help with my statistics. So here is my question: 

I have a group of medical students that completed questionnaires on depression, anxiety, and alcohol and drug use. The depression and data can be raw scores from the questionnaire, or categorized by the severity of depression symptoms (5 groups), or categorized in two groups of those who do and do not meet clinical criteria. The alcohol and drug use categorizes users as those with high or low risk alcohol use, and with and without drug use (2 groups for alcohol and 2 groups for drug use). The data is very skewed so I know that I need to use nonparametric stats. I'm just having a hard time figuring out which one to use. This is where i am hoping someone can help me pick the most appropriate test. 

The question im trying to answer is whether there is any relationship between depression and anxiety with alcohol and drug use. 

If anyone would be able to help point me in the right direction I would be so very grateful!",How often are you watering it? It’s little hard to tell from the picture but are these leaves coming from the center as new leaves or are they on the outer edge?,It’s never a bad idea to call your doctors office to find out what they recommend. Chances are they will be able to help you make sure that your appointments line up so you don’t run out of pills. Almost all doctors would rather you call them to work out a plan together rather than be left feeling stuck trying to figuring it out on your own.,Oh yay! I’m so glad to hear that. Thank you so much!!,After a couple of months in its new home this plant is THRIVING again. Thank you so much!!!,My money tree has been having some tough times lately. I was over watering it for a bit and it lost a bunch of leaves while still putting out new ones. I’ve cut back on the watering and there are still new leaves growing (yay!) but now these two little yellow mushrooms have popped up. What did I do wrong? Is this going to hurt my plant?,I didn’t realize that the sunburn could be this grey color. I always assumed it was always like brown. It sounds like I really just need to move it out from the plant light. Thanks so much for responding!,Oh a pebble tray is a great idea. I’ll try moving it to somewhere else and adding that. Thanks for the suggestion!,There’s nothing on the leaf that can be wiped away. It looks like it’s the leaf itself that is greying. All the leaves that have it shows grey on both sides of the leaf.,I was misting it but I noticed it leaving like calcium deposits on my other plants so I stopped. I’ve been using tap water to water them and just letting it sit out before using it.,I’ve had this plant for probably at least 6 months and up until now it’s been pretty happy. I’m pretty sure it’s getting enough water and I have it sitting under my plant grow light. Is it too much sun? Not enough?

I tried wiping them down with a damp cloth and I feel like it didn’t work great. Is there something else I should try using?,Im going to try cutting back on the watering a bit to see if that helps. I’m glad to hear yours is thriving though!! They’re such pretty plants.,Omg thank you so so much!!  I will definitely check these out!!,I just got it a couple weeks ago so maybe it’s still from being rescued from the clearance plants. I’ve been watering it once the top inch of soil is dry. Does that sound right? I have been waiting for so long to get one of these. I would be so sad if I killed it.
gableon,"My mind is no longer making me see and think horrible things, or at least, not as much.

I’ve begun doing some light exercises and yoga (after I got over how ridiculous I probably look like in some poses haha) and those things have actually helped me feel better about myself and gives me something to look forward to. Also, I’ve always been absolutely terrible at drawing but I’ve always wanted to draw so a few weeks ago I started practicing (Drawabox and youtube vids), and while I still got a LONG way ahead of me, creating something feels good.

Whenever I think of my future, I still see it bleakly not going to lie. As a 21, almost 22 y/o college dropout with no talents (not self-deprecation, just honesty), no goals and an absolute lack of faith in the College system, the future still scares me a lot.

But I’m finally able to think happy thoughts alongside the horrible stuff. My mind is being nicer to me, and that’s worth celebrating.

I truly hope all of you are feeling better or working towards it. It’s possible!","Half of Americans have been duped and brainwashed by Trump, so I think it’s safe to say that yes. Yes they are.

Edit: Of course, religion has made said duping far easier than it would be otherwise. Like literally always.","Okay so update: I haven’t reached s14. I’m finishing s12 rn and, like every other show that has existed for more than 10 seasons, it’s gotten worse imo. I could eat through s1-7 no prob even though I watched those episodes a few weeks ago. S10-12 havent been BAD perse but I have had to force myself into continue watching. Some of the characters changes were funny for a while but by now stopped being funny to me and the incessant need to callback a previous episode constantly seems really meh to me. Which I assume it’s cause I binge watched it instead of waiting a year like long-time fans did, so to me it feels like “haha remember this funnier episode? Well now here’s an worse episode about that”. The Gang goes to Hell though was sooooo funny to me. When Dee made her Obama impression I absolutely lost it (shoutout to another person that replied an mentioned these episodes). And just like those, there have been really funny episodes lurking throughout these seasons. 


And I agree btw, Dee & Dennis ARE my favorite duo with a close second being Dee & Charlie. And rn idk if those pairs work so well cause they aren’t given to us as often or cause of the script or cause of the actors’ talent. But either way, I enjoy those pairs a lot.","As a Hozier fan, it’s wild to me seeing Anya Taylor in so many subreddits I follow. I’m glad though, she was an incredible actress in that series.

For anyone wondering, she appeared in a Hozier music video about a year or two ago. The song is Dinner & Diatribes if anyone wants to check it out, it’s a good song. I didn’t know it was her until I checked her IMDB page. 

Also, this is a wonderful painting. I feel it catches Anya’s character perfectly.","I think when things started to get needlessly convoluted was in KH2, with BBS being the last game with a pretty digestible plot. KH1 and KHCOM are fine.
It’s wild to read this because that’s the thing, for me at least, I felt there were no conclusions whatsoever. Like, anywhere. And the very few there were, were not satisfying at all. I’m genuinely glad you got what you needed out of it thought.


I think what makes KH3 particularly stand out in this regard is that it had no middle-point. Like no huge event at the middle that hyped you up for the 3rd act of the game. Like KH1’s Neverland/Hollow Bastion and KH2’s 1000 heartless battle/teaming up with FF characters. So the game basically feels like it starts high and as you progress, it gets worse and worse with nothing concrete actually happening until the very end.","Yeah, but I’d be interested only in the data battles and Yozora and I really can’t justify paying $30 for that. However, I do agree that that particular part is very polished. The battles, the soundtrack, everything-from what I’ve seen- seems incredibly fun. If the dlc is ever at a price I find reasonable, I’ll go for it but for now I’ll pass on ReMind.","I fully agree. 
After KH3 I lost all faith so I didn’t even bother buying ReMind cause I knew it wasn’t going to deliver anything that was going to actually improve the overall game for me. Rn I’m sticking around cause I still find the gameplay fun, so I’ll wait until the next actual game of the series to decide if I hop off this train or not. But I’m completely done giving a shit about the plot or the characters.","That’s not the argument you think it is. Quite the contrary, that means the plot has been sub-par and more egregiously, dissatisfying, for a long time now.

And it’s quite normal for fans of a series to critique that which they love; if an ending was disappointing, they’ll most likely buy the next one with the hopes of it actually delivering this time. KH3, however, broke a lot of people (their interests in the series and it’s plot, I mean) and as such, will and should receive a lot of shit.",I think that my thing with Pretty Boy is that I feel it should’ve been a solely Joji song. I loved his short version of it so much that Yachty’s part is too different from the og song we originally heard. It contrasts with each other too much imo.,"I agree. This might be controversial, but I think she’s the only featured artist that *adds* to the song rather than substract from it. I’m looking at you Pretty Boy.",I’m looking forward to them! I just finished watching the Chardee MacDennis episode and those are the type of episodes I absolutely love and the one you mentioned sounds like that.,"I can see that, distancing themselves from bar-centric episodes have definitely game them the chance to lean into bat-shit crazy situations and good episodes. And I guess that’s why Frank was added into the show, since he has money, they don’t really need to worry about money.","I thought that too, but I think I prefer afterthought’s message and tone. It’s more chill and I prefer that over Ew’s amazing vocals. I do have to admit that Ew’s chorus is godlike though.","1) I find Cricket’s story soooo dark. Like he had it all figured out, one encounter with the gang and it’s all downhill from there. Still, the actor and his script make his appearances funny af and even show-stealing. 

2) Around s6 I noticed some episodes weren’t available on Hulu, I looked it up and they were pulled a few months ago when companies and corporations were doing the bare minimum and doing things absolutely no one asked for to appear progressive or whatever amidst the BLM movement. Kinda sucks cause that waters down the movement and makes it seem like it’s for things like these the movement emerged... anyways I read the stickied post and it says no politics so I’ll stop there. But it kinda sucks I can’t watch some episodes when in the very first episode Charlie drops the N-word with a hard r lmao.

3) This show feels like a live-action version of South Park, wherein they take a seemingly benign subject and turn it into the most absurd thing ever and I love it. However, I do miss the first few seasons when they actually gave a shit about the bar and customers and whatnot.

4) I hate Mac but he’s funny af. I think I hate him cause while the rest of the cast are exaggerated versions of people, some to a comical level, I HAVE met many Mac’s in my life so it activated my fight or flight. Like the only time I can say that the cringe level of IASIP reaches Michael from The Office levels of cringe is when Mac’s around lmao. 

5) I never thought I’d see Danny Devito’s ass in my lifetime but here we are. 

6) Artemis is queen, I need more of her.

7) Okay, this is the first critique; I don’t really like the direction The Waitress went. Idk, her crush on Dennis stopped being funny *to me* around the 2nd time they used it to excuse her doing/being around for whatever episode they needed her. Like at this point, either make her as absolutely despicable as the gang or smart enough to win over them. 

8) In my opinion, episodes are better when they stop treating Dee *SO* badly. Like when Dennis and Dee have a partnership, it usually turns out to be a great and funny episode. Like with The Waitress, it stopped being funny relatively quickly. It sucks cause I think Dee’s actress’s hilarious and when the episode is set up on the gang ignoring her, she can’t interact fully with the gang and imo, that’s to the episode’s detriment.

9) I’ve been able to read some opinions on google without spoiling myself, and those opinions have been that Danny Devito isn’t that funny or can’t carry an episode on his own. And while the latter has been true so far, I think it’s more the script’s fault than Danny. I love his addition to the show. I think he’s funny af. Something that knocks me out everytime is that whenever he says ‘whore’, he says like it ‘hoore’ and idk why but I find that soooo funny. 

10) Does the gang at any point talk about Frank being Charlie’s father? That has bothered me waaay more than it should’ve, I’ll admit. But it feels like that could turn into such a fun episode or even a two-parter.

Anyways those are some of my thoughts.","That last verse is so satisfying to me lmao. 
Also, Ew and Afterthought are competing for my fave track on that album.","Yeah, I don’t hate it perse but this really does suck. I get why but it makes for an, sometimes, “fuck you lol” experience the first time around when you don’t know when’s the phase-shift for the bosses.",I aspire for this amount of willpower,"I’m replaying through the game after a few months, and now I’m noticing the textures and other little things that feel can be fixed with not too much trouble and it’s bothering me rn waaay more than it did at release and idek why but it does.

And on the dlc front, I read that a Tifa chapter was cut that fits perfectly as DLC. Iirc, it was a chapter telling Tifa’s story after Cloud falls in chapter 7 and how she ends up going into Corneo’s mansion and whatnot. Even if not that, a dlc adding some new battles on the coliseum or something. Playing through the game again has made me sooooo hungry for new content yall dont even know haha.","Hey im from Puerto Rico so idk how much this will apply to u but we also had in mind huge changes for this election, it didn’t happen so we had to celebrate every single small victory we gained. We broke the bipartisan hold on a few positions and whatnot (idk the english terms sorry haha) and the person who might become our capital’s mayor is a non-bipartisan candidate. 

We had a few hours of despair but then clarity enters and when the light sheds in, just a little bit, we remember that hope is always there.",This belongs in the Not the Onion subreddit,"I binged through the show never really loving it (a lot of it is cringey, and everytime they replaced a bad word with “shirt” or whatever it automatically ruined whatever joke they were going for), but I kept watching just to see more of Jason’s face. But goddamn, if Sitcoms know how to deliver a gut wrenching ending. I was crying through most of the episode.","In my experience, the thing that got me was how many variations each enemy type has. There are a LOT of flans, ahrimans, beasts, wolfs, thicc enemies (idr how they’re called) and then there’s also other types of enemies that are beaten the exact same way as the ones I mentioned. Flans=elementals, wolfs=lizards, ahrimans=birds, and so on. 



*Mini rant about FFX below*

I honestly loved FFX as a child but I played through it a few months ago and I found it torturous tbh. The sphere grid felt like way too much of a hassle and never rewarding, the gameplay was so simple and non engaging (fast enemy, use tidus. flying enemy, use wakka. Flan, Lulu.), I hate how the remasters don’t have a skip cutscene option, and it has arguably the worst post-game content in all of FF— the sheer monotonous journey that is completing the Coliseum and then fighting in it, the fucking awful minigames, and the bosses that can just be Quick Hit to death If you decided to put in the days of work and agony to complete the sphere grid. All of it is just blegh to me.(in all of rpg, in my opinion)",Was he? I remember him being incredibly buff in both Spidey movies.,"I agree on that first part. Every single time I’ve criticized a chapter or an aspect of One Piece, doesn’t matter how I go about it, I receive downvotes to oblivion and snarky ass comments lmao so I don’t even bother anymore.","I think I’d go with naming my starter Jojo and then the hm-slave would go with a Speedwagon-type character name.

And then the legendary’s named after a main villain.","I went through something very similar. I loved Squall and Quistis, reached the mid-point of disc 2 but idk what happened I just stopped playing. Still haven’t finished it to this day, it being the only classic FF I haven’t finished.","Yup, I’m currently replaying through OG FF7 and that snowaboarding game is OOF, to say the least.","I agree with all of this.

However I have to say, I recently replayed FF 9 and FF X (the 2 FF’s that most people say are the best FF’s if other than FF 6 and 7) and I have to say, I think I lowkey hate them. FF 9 was super slow (even with fast forward option on the ps4 version), it felt sloppy, I hated grinding battles just to learn abilities so I could actually choose which gear to equip my party, hated the trance mechanic, hated Steiner, I didn’t connect with any of the Party (except Vivi which is in my top 5 FF characters), and FF X was super good when I first played it on the ps2 years ago, but when I played the remaster... oof, no matter how u feel about the game itself, i think everyone has to admit that it’s a shitty remaster. It doesn’t have any QoL improvements, even KH1 received a skip-scenes option, FFX didnt. Not even in the ps4 version. I loathed the sphere grid, and the minigames for the sigils were so horrible, boring and tedious that it absolutely knocks it down like 3 points for me. It does has one of my favorites casts of party members, I love everyone except Kimahri (special shoutout to Auron, Yuna and Lulu). But the battles were so formulaic— speedy enemy; use Tidus. Flying enemy, use Wakka. Elemental enemy, use Lulu.

And a few people have said FF7 is easy, and that’s absolutely true, but whenever I load up whichever version of FF7 I know I’m in for a good time. The soundtrack is absolutely legendary, whenever a song pops up it makes me feel what it should make me feel— dread, joy, bubbly, hyped, it completes its purpose. I relate immensely to Cloud, Tifa and Aerith. Tifa and Aerith being 2 of my favorite female characters of ANY medium, Tifa being in my top 5 fictional characters periodt. And also, FF7 accomplishes something I absolutely adore of RPGS; DIVERSITY. Ff7 was the first game I saw a black person being a main party member (Barrett has some, in retrospective, problematic things going on but alas), a literal dog, an asian woman, a vampire, and so on. I love it. Not like FF9 that had characters of diverse races but they were all humanoid so they really didn’t seem or feel different. This was something FF6 and FF7 absolutely nailed and has been missing ever since. 

I went on a tangent I apologize lmao, the person that posted the comment I’m replying to even said he doesn’t like FF9 but I guess I just felt like dropping some hot takes and opinions haha.

I think this goes without saying but just in case: this is not a knock down to those that enjoy the games I don’t, this is fully my opinions on those games and though I didn’t went in full detail, FF9 and FFX do a few things I, though disliked, can respect and such.","Now THIS is a hot take, I wanna know more. In what sense you do feel it surpassed it? Characters, plot, gameplay, all of the above?"
ragna777,"My cousin moved away to another country a few years ago and it has been a slow decline ever since.
He’s going through economic troubles, anger issues and like I said in the title he’s at the worst point of depression. His depression is violent while mine is just sad so while I can relate to him a lot of the times, the way we go about it is completely different which lead to different results. I’ve never been an angry person and I know how to control my emotions for the most part and he’s the exact opposite. 

He’s volatile and fragile right now so whenever he hears something he doesn’t want to hear, he hangs up in a fit of rage. So how can I help him if whenever I try to nudge him to therapy, or give him ideas of hobbies to distract his mind, or suggest that maybe he’s going about certain things the wrong way and so on, he just completely closes and refuses to hear it.
I last talked to him 2 days ago, and from what he told me he has that sort of persecution feeling where his mind is making him think that everyone thinks he’s a failure and a burden and a waste of space mixed with a lack of taking responsibility. He blames his past, and his parents for his shitty actions and assumes no responsibility whatsoever. Idk if this might be controversial but I think that NO ONE is at fault for their trauma, but what they do with/because of that trauma is absolutely their responsibility and weight to carry.

I was going through some of the same things he told me a few months ago when I was the one going through the worst of it but I don’t know how to get through to him or talk to him without making him feel talked down to or pitied or whatever. I never realized how being a generally angry person could make helping a depressed person that much difficult. 

I wish I could help him more. It’s unrealistic and unhealthy to assume I, or any of you, can say or do anything to really help him but if I could just help him just a little bit, I’d feel better cause I think he just needs a push to get him back in track. I never went to therapy (was gonna but the pandemic happened), I’ve just gotten better through dealing with my own issues head-on, new hobbies, etc. Since that’s such a personal way of getting through it, it won’t help him. And since I never went to therapy myself, I still am working through some of the things he’s telling me plus I wasn’t able to pick up some tricks/helpful words to relay to him.

I’m scared for him and I feel useless.","While I’m excited, I’ll keep my expectations as low as possible cause Squeenix has a horrendous track record on actually delivering a great product on their most expected games.",Snapchat o whatsapp o lo que sea. Quiero conocer gente nueva de nosotros jaja.,"Can I ask what made u feel like Base KH3 had a deep combat, even before ReMind?
Cause for ME, a deep combat system is all based on how many options the player has and how the player has controls of said options, what choices, we as players, make, you know what I mean? If I know a move I’m not good at dodging or blocking, can I i-frames limit my way out of it? In theory, yes but I have a 30 secs-window for it so if it doesn’t appear right before the move that’s killing me, then.....?","My main gripe with KH3 isn’t the gameplay though. And I’ve seen that, Btw, I’ve seen a few videos of the non-ReMind DLC fights and they really are stunning so I agree with that. The soundtracks, the Bosses’ moves, all of it is epic and I do miss not playing that, but my issues are with the plot really.

But I do have to disagree on the KH2 part, all of those options were available on Base KH2 (summons, magic, limits, drives). They just weren’t necessary cause it was easy af, just like Base KH3 was but the difference for me is, that KH2FM crit is balanced to perfection, even level 1 crit, whereas KH3’s crit isn’t. I did play through the game a second time after crit came and it was a fun time, like I said, I do think KH3’s gameplay is super fun but it isn’t balanced for level 1 playthroughs and that’s not a knock on KH3 in and of itself but, it wasn’t really *balanced* even on a non-level 1 playthrough. The enemies just dish out more damage and iirc, you have less HP and MP. Doesn’t make it more fun or makes u utilize other tools, cause all the tools on KH3 are, essentially, by chance, it just makes you dodge and wait out certain attacks.",Yeah I figured as much. It kinda sucks cause after playing the remake I kinda wanna see Tifa or Aerith’s date scene lmao but the plat comes before all rn. Thank u!,Ooh yes! Thank u for reminding ne of Jegged’s existence!,"I for one, never met an unattractive Ian.

Like I don’t hate Ansem or Xemnas but the fight/s are soooo unfun to me.
KH3 had the spectacle though, even though the fights themselves weren’t my favorite.

BBS though, the plot and the importance of these fights with the characters who fight them, almost makes this an absolutely amazing ending for me. (Is it obvious BBS is my favorite KH plotwise yet?)

Is there any streaming app that has it? Like I just took the free trial for Roku to watch season 7-10 and AS3. (they don’t have s11-12, nor AS 4-5)

I’m from US.
Well, from Puerto Rico but I’m pretty sure what streaming app/services offer to the US, also counts for PR.","I’ve watched s1-6 but skipped s7 since I knew who won, went to 8 and now I’m on 9 but I also got spoiled on who won and am currently thinking to just continue on to season 10. The same goes for all star 3. So I’m wondering which season is so good (lip syncs, challenge performances, queens, drama) that it doesn’t even matter u know who ends up winning?","This is also very true, I hadn’t seen it in that point of view.","Well, while I still am amazed at OP’s Worldbuilding, worldbuilding isn’t everything. I adore Harry Potter’s worldbuilding but I’m not a fan of much else. 


I interpreted what my friend said as: okay it’s been 20+ years, we need the payoff for all this buildup. And I can’t lie, I kinda agree with that. Like yes, I love the characters/plot but at the same time, I need closure haha. 

Also, you really can’t compare GoT with OP cause Oda’s been at it pretty consistently despite hiatuses or breaks. GRRM on the otherhand.....","Mine was Queen Mab. I made her a mage/buffer and she was dealing almost or more damage than some of my other personas with higher magic. She stuck with me from mid-game all the way till the end.

I read that the speed up feature doesn’t affect the clock so that’s even better ha,"I played this game in the PS3 way back when but never finished it for some reason, over the years I’ve tried to come back to it but never got too far cause I’ve lost patience and found it so slow but the ps4 verison has the speed option and the no encounters so I want to enjoy the adventure all the way through this time!",Bottom is Ollie one of my personal faves (just recently discovered him lmao) and top is Dario,"Also, I sell nudes. I know that’s often times looked down upon but I rather be upfront. So... I guess if anyone is interested in that, you can also dm me about it. Thank you, and I hope yall doing well!",i’d love to follow that trail 😍,"1- I never saw it that way but you’re right on the BBS part. I guess since she’s the character you play as for the most part, and she acts as the clean-up for the guys’ mistakes on the worlds PLUS she’s like, what? The only female keyblade wielder you use for an actual main portion of the game? That adds to her character for me but that’s entirely dependant on the player.

2- I know it’s not a shipping thing but I really think that post KH1, if it was only Sora-Riku (be it romantically, if japan had the balls to break off of the norm or just a platonic friendship) their relationship could be better for it since Kairi, unfortunately, hasn’t added much to her trio since... way too much time.

3- Seeing it from this POV, I can definitely see what you mean about Namine. Namine wasn’t exactly proactive, much less the decider of her life but she sure as hell was competent. My issue with Namine is she’s just another “motherly”, soft-spoken female Squeenix character. I might have to replay ReCom without skipping scenes this time to actually get more out of her character though. 

4- N/A

5- I havent experienced ReMind just yet so maybe when I actually do, my mind may change about certain characters. I hope it does!","I agree.

On Larxene though, while I agree, I feel she’s not necessarily a *good female character* and moreso a (the only) different female character and as such she stands out more than the others.","This is something I had on my mind for a while, not just about KH but about other media I love (Jojo’s, One Piece, etc) but I want to start with KH since it’s my favorite videogame series.

Basically I want to start a conversation on how it’s fanbase feels about the woman characters — their importance on the plot, how proactive they are, how good or bad a character they are by *themselves*, their design, their powers, how they’re portrayed in comparison to their male counterparts (this one goes hard af in KH since basically every character has a counterpart to compare to), and so and so forth.


In my very humble opinion, Aqua is the only female character done right but she has things which drag her back which I’ll cover later on. For now, the good: She’s one of the most important pieces in the KH lore/plot. She can handle things on her own, she’s graceful, nice, *powerful*. Her design, imo, is one of the best of the series. I’m like one of the three people that absolutely loves her voice and voice acting. She gets things done by *herself*. 

But, something I’ve noticed is that in the KH series every female character basically... acts the same?
They sorta have the same cadence, tone and way of talking? They’re all calm, reserved, soft-spoken, most of them need to be saved by their male friend at some point (Aqua breaks the mold in this one, becoming herself, the “savior” of her group but KH3 threw that out the window WOOPS) And that’s one of the detriments holding back the KH females. Kairi KH1 is the only one that doesn’t fit into this role, but I might be wrong.


Most of this things I’ve said disbar Larxene btw. She’s also a relatively well-done female character in the KHverse. She’s amazing, I love her. But there’s nothing more to her than “fun villain lol” (at the moment), now that I think about it, she sorta fits an Harley Quinn-esque role in the KHverse. This isn’t to say that she’s not allowed in this conversation though, maybe some of you have more in-depth feelings/thoughts about her and those are very welcomed!

There’s a lot of thing I could add to this but I’m gonna leave it here for now, I just want to see y’all’s opinions on this, if yall even have one.


Disclaimer: The point of this post isn’t to turn this into a male vs female thing, or something like that. It’s just something I find really interesting and which I hope I could have an interesting, analytical discussion about.
I’m probably not the best to open up this conversation though, but still haha.",thank you ❤️,And here I was thinking you meant it as a sort of part 7 joke or something lmao

Just delivering canned responses. 

I didn't say no one dies from the flu. And I didn't say no one would die after a vaccine is released. I didn't even say anything close to that. I said COVID is more deadly than the flu, which it is. It has taken far, far more lives than the flu in a year. It spreads more easily. These are just facts. 

Your paranoid predictions about future flu seasons, however, are based on nothing. ""Doomers"" = people able to acknowledge the reality of the situation and that their actions can mean life or death or disability for someone else. 

I reached out to you because I was desperate to understand how a good person could justify throwing the whole state under the bus. I've learned that it's just as I thought: a good person couldn't. You aren't even making an attempt to sound like a good person. Just someone out for himself.

Thanks for clearing that up for me. Bye, then.","No, because there is currently an approved vaccine for the flu, which I do get every year, and there are [a multitude of differences ](https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/no-covid-19-is-not-the-flu.html) between the two viruses. 


COVID is more likely to cause severe disease and death, is more easily transmitted, and takes longer to show symptoms, leading to more transmission by presymptomatic people. 

Every year, all year, I don't visit someone if I'm sick. With COVID, you can't be sure you aren't sick (presymptomatic or asymptomatic carrier) if you've been around anyone within about 2 weeks. So it's the same protocol. Assume you're sick if it's plausible you've contracted it, and then don't be a dick and spread it around by visiting people.","How are you not convinced? There's tons of evidence and just standard old logic. The virus doesn't just float down the street looking for victims. People carry it to each other. Every place that has residents avoid unnecessary travel sees a decline in cases. 

It wouldn't be a year off life. It's a year of a different life so that other people can keep their life. You can't slow down so someone (likely a few people) can literally stay alive?

I told you that I am following the rules, and because of people like you, I and my loved ones aren't safe from this anyway. This isn't a role play. This is real life. Your decisions have real repercussions. This is no different than choosing to drive drunk. Yes, ""the world is a dangerous place, always has been."" But that's not a justification to actively make it a more dangerous place and then blame other people for not staying out of the way of your careless and disregard for others. That's narcissistic. 

I am just absolutely stunned at how selfish, immature, and cruel people are. So fucking easy to save lives and they're too wrapped up in themselves to care. I know each of us goes to bed at night thinking we're good people, but I'm not sure how you sell yourself on that.","But why? Why won't you at all modify your behavior to help us get out of this? I don't understand. 

I've been staying home since this started in March. But my family still isn't safe. I need childcare. It isn't as simple as ""if you're scared stay home."" I'm home. I'm not safe, my infant isn't safe, because of this type of behavior.

I have family members who are at high risk. My grandma with a terminal illness needs people to come and help her. Of course she's staying home, but she's not safe. My mom has risk factors, but she has to work with the public. She does what she can to stay safe, but her health is highly dependent on the decisions of the people who come into her business. 

My cousin is paraplegic with reduced lung function. If she gets this, she'll die. Shes taken care of by family members, one of whom recently tested positive, likely from interacting with medical staff, as she ""stays home because she's scared."" We aren't safe, because of people like you. 

I don't understand this callous attitude of letting people die and be seriously ill (like medically induced coma, months of hospitalization, long term side effects for many who don't die), to spite a governor you don't like. 

Help me understand because I can't figure out why so many Wisconsities, my neighbors in a state I grew up in and love, refuse to take small measures that could save my family members' lives.","Are they refusing to work, or are they in quarantine for exposure? 

Were those who were laid off in roles to address this pandemic, to free up resources to work on this crisis? 

I don't see why you think hospitals having 30% of their capacity working on COVID means that COVID isn't a big deal. That capacity used to be for the people who are sick and dying in other ways, and it's now for one single virus. 

About 20% of people who get diagnosed with COVID get hospitalized, so yea, as cases continue to skyrocket, more and more people will be sent to the field hospital.","Fat chance of that. There's a shit ton of research going on, and they're not going to disable the research enterprise that's incredibly important to UW's success. If people are in labs, they need the custodial and facilities staff keeping things running.

Normal_Newspaper6278,"Recently, my doctor prescribed me some anti-depressants. Prozac IIRC. TBH I was only calling because I wanted an ADHD related prescription but I'm too much of a coward to directly ask for one.

I'm currently seeing a therapist but it's not going well. I really don't want to take anti-depressants, I've heard too many bad things about them to consider the risk being worth it. The risk of weight gain is a huge turn of for me.

The thing is that therapy isn't doing much for me. I don't know if there's anything a therapist can tell me that I'd buy into anymore. My current therapist isn't too good either.

BTW I do exercise frequently and try to get outside. I just don't feel like anything helps that much. Like I'm trying to trick my mind but my mind knows my own playbook and isn't stupid.

Most of my regrets are related to my university degree and how I struggle to keep trying when I've failed a lot in life despite getting my BA and MA.","I (25m) have started seeing a not great therapist because I've been feeling not great mentally since graduating with my MA in poli sci last year. So far she hasn't been too useful. She doesn't get how not useful an MA or BA are. Moreover, when I told her I can't get myself to apply for jobs she doesn't really help me that much. She just tells me to apply for jobs which I find fucking useless because if I could do that I wouldn't need her. TBH I think I might have ADHD that's just misdiagnosed. 

What is a therapist going to do that's so useful?

I feel condemned to amount to little to nothing rn and I don't know how therapy is realistically going to help me overcome never being able to get anywhere because of my lower middle class background and just being on the outside all the time. I never felt treated to well for most of university and I don't have too many useful qualifications to move forward career wise.

I'm not sure any therapist, even an understanding one can help me very much.

 Should I just stick to cigarettes, alcohol and try drugs? I don't feel like there's anything useful anyone can say to me at this point?","I agree. It sucks talking to the therapist I’m currently seeing is trying to tell me university is over which it is but in some ways what I was expecting to get out of university never happened and imo it’s hard for therapsids to competently relate to someone who is lower middle class when they are probably working a decent middle class job and are solidly employed, or come from a decent background to see them. They don’t see the dynamics of class or if they do they don’t know what to do about feeling constantly self aware because 4+ years drilled it into your head.

Therapy won’t make me believe in myself as much as getting a more useful degree or lucking out into a decent job. Hell even some better dating prospects would help a lot rn. I’m 25 and I feel like I’m a bitter, cynical 17 year old who will never experience things in life but no one has the time of day to seriously listen to and believe me.

Lastly, I think therapists don’t get the emotional toll of how constantly failing wears down on you mentally. Like, no lady I’m not just going to apply for jobs and hope I get something anymore when I’ve been broken down by years of rejection among my peers. Like, I think it’s something therapy can help if done properly but you need to understand it well before you can help people with such issues.",Doesn’t mean you have to stalk people,"Thanks for the kind words! Tbh I’d feel a lot better if people were genuinely sympathetic and acknowledged that it’s pretty hard for people like me and you.

I was hoping to become a policy analyst, some other sort of civil service employee or a police officer but all of those jobs have thousands of applicants for hundreds of positions and I’m never going to be anything special. It doesn’t help that I kills myself mentally to get through university. Also, a lot of the people from my university came from higher off backgrounds and didn’t talk to me because I was a commuter townie basically",Back under your bridge troll,Are you projecting your insecurities on to me?,"Well said. I think another part is short sightedness in the sense that some people either have a decent job or know someone with one and don’t know what happened to all the rejects. Out of sight out of mind.

Also, why acknowledge hard truths when you can just say other people have a ‘victim mentality’ and call it a day? What’s empathy. Jk","Agreed. It’s not easy to accept that no matter what one can do there’s a lot of things that you can’t control in life or have little control over.

It’s like what Marx said, men are free but not in circumstances of their choosing. Or a something like that anyways.

For me, it’s frustrating how I went to the same university as other people and while some of them got nice government summer jobs or internships or into nice programs, I could never amount to anything despite doing relatively the same thing.

Rn I feel really uncomfortable around solid middle class wealth because no matter what I seem to do it never works and now I’m at the point where I’d rather not try than continue to try and get nowhere. It’s hard to apply for jobs where you know you’re not close to being well qualified.

I think part of what you’re referring to has been called the “just world hypothesis” where people think good things happen to good, deserving people and as a result they rationalize where they are and hate people who contradict their beliefs out of some insecurity.

I just wish people would admit that life is really hard and sometimes you’ll go nowhere. It’s like everyone has some solution that’s just bound to work but when it doesn’t work or underperforms  they never apologize for giving  you that advice or admit that they could be wrong.

Idk, my life for the most part has sucked for one reason or another and I just can’t dig my way out of it. Not too many people acknowledge that being lower middle class with an hard to pronounce ethnic first name doesn’t help.

Rn it just feels like it’s hard to believe in future success when you’ve never had any. Not too many folks ever acknowledge that.  Like how many times do you never get what you want before. 

Tbh I don’t think therapy or meds would ever work for me. They can’t change where you’re at in life.

Thanks so much for the kind and astute response","Maybe. They’ve told me basically the same thing when I wasn’t unemployed for a while. It’s really more when I ask for advice on Reddit but my aunt is like that too.

I agree, people just figure that they somehow got a job so you must somehow be able to as well. Survivor bias I guess. It doesn’t help that I never fit in at university so a lot of people don’t get being lower middle class or don’t get that just because they got out means I ever can.

Lastly, I think some people find job postings online and don’t get the loads of applicants applying for those jobs.",I’m sorry to hear that :( not fitting in really sucks in life and the people who do fit in have no idea what it’s like and often little sympathy,I’m not but thanks for assuming I’m a jerk,"FWIW, I can’t really find a new place to fit at home. I’ve just been unemployed for a year and I lack practical skills. FWIW, I’ll try to get to a better place if I ever stop feeling like life is over for me

Also, my family doesn’t get angry at it but refuses to acknowledge it and I find when I look for some sort of support on Reddit I don’t get it too often. Looking at r/grad school.","LOL, probably. People don’t like bleak and overwhelming truths. 

I’m pretty sure on a side note, that the people I went to university with wouldn’t say they had no time of day for me but that doesn’t make it true. It just sucks because I don’t have anything left mentally or emotionally anymore to give but I don’t have a great future. It also sucks that I was raised to aspire for middle class goals and I’d rather kill myself than accept significantly less. It’s just one of the few things I have left.

Maybe if my social and dating life were better it’d be a different story","Thanks. I just wish it didn’t break me
I’m the process. I don’t think I can ever get out of where I’m at.",It depends are you a fake Marxist in university or a real one? We have to know,"I come from a lower middle class background and despite going to university (BA and MA in poli sci). I commuted and hour by city bus each way and tbh I just felt alienated from my peers for most of university. I just felt very self aware and class conscious. I really struggled to make friends or get dates as a commuter student.

Hell, university broke me down so much I’ve just been unemployed for a year since graduating. As well, I always weirdly seem to miss out on good summer job opportunities other people had.

When I try telling some people this they get weirdly angry at me for some reason. Why is this?

I’m not saying people can’t rise beyond the lower middle class but statistically speaking anyone is far more likely to stay in it than leave. 

I figure I’d fire a baseball manager for betting against the odds but when it comes to precious false values then it’s personal.

I'd emphasize that you don't let him treat you poorly, be that by refusing to engage him or calling him out on his behavior.","I (25m) finished my MA in political science last September, 2019. Since then I haven't done anything or amounted to anything with my life. I've just been unemployed and unable to concentrate. I was initially planning to take 6 months off before trying to put my life together before Covid hit. 

I was in a master of public policy program with a good coop this September but I dropped out because the program wasn't what I thought it'd be like and Zoom classes suck. It doesn't help that I'm not qualified to do much.

**What do I do now? Should I go back to school for something more practical?**

**Has anything similar happened to anyone else?**",Amen. In a sense you have to laugh at narcissists because you know at a certain level they're weak and pathetic.,"It sounds like your brother might also be a narcissist since he seems delusional and has a victim complex. He could be what you call a covert or vulnerable narcissist. You'd think given his age, he'd want to do something just because he'd get bored and embarrassed.

Alternatively, you might want to see if ADHD therapy would help him. Sometimes meds alone don't help for ADHD","Yeah, I figured if it’s a strong pattern is probably part of a larger issue. In this case narcissism.","Thanks so much. I’m planning on building the courage to ask to get tested. I also plan on doing some research so I know which sometimes to describe. It sucks because when you walk into a doctor’s appointment you don’t think that when you tell them you’re having trouble focusing that they’re going to screen you for depression but not ADHD.

Thanks so much for getting back to me I appreciate it a lot.",Like that there are a lot of people in general who do this or a lot of people with narcissistic tendencies?,"I have a cousin who is sort of similar. Sucks to hear. I hate people who have decent to even good lives but instead just complain and put others down all the time. They are truly pathetic. What's worse is that a lot of the people around them, especially those who might hold a bit more authority over them never call them out on their crap and refuse to deal with them or punish them for doing so.

For example, that cousin of mine basically insulted my alma matter when I was grabbing lunch with him, my uncle (his dad), my other uncle, and my brother and while I just left an awkward silence. In hindsight, I'm thinking shouldn't someone like my cousin's dad have stepped in and told him not to do that sort of crap? I'd never talk to anyone like that. My mom tried telling me I was too sensitive. 

It sucks because a lot of narcs have family members or friends who enable their behavior and buy into their victimization attitude and never call them out. Also, said cousin is kind of racist and complains about people ripping off welfare programs but has no objections to taking them."
Da14c1256,It's just easier to be sad than happy. Once you have one bad thought it all works like a machine and keeps on going. Being happy takes effort.,"I think it's hard to completely change your behaviour towards her overnight. Instead of flipping a switch and being nice for 2-3 weeks I suggest changing the smaller things. Maybe slowly change habits of yours, bit by bit and then you can be a better person. Did that make sense? 

Maybe you've been stressed out and need to relax. When was the last time you did something special together or had some time alone? I think you should try do something to make up for this behaviour. Even something small like getting flowers will be thoughtful.",Now I will never use a hotel kettle again,I think you missed my point. The tattoo is not more important than my grandparents. Being free to express myself is important and I want my grandparents to accept me. I understand they may not like this. I was just asking for advice on how I should explain to them how it's not bad and maybe find a middle ground so everyone can be at peace.,Smoking anything can potentially make you cough lol.,"Yeah that's a good idea. I'll try to be as casual about it as possible. It kinda worked with my hair changing colour (only 3x a year), they don't like it but I think they're getting used to it. So I guess the same could work for my tattoo and future tattoos?","I have told them in the past I want tattoos and I will keep changing my hair colour. So it shouldn't be a huge surprise to them but still a surprise. I guess I should explain to them more about London culture, because in Russia when people get tattoos it means something a bit different.

And using illness to control the youth is so messed up. A while ago I told my mum I want a tattoo and she implied to wait until my grandparents pass away so they will not be here to condemn me. I just thought it's so messed up that for me to be free to express myself my grandparents have to be dead first. I decided I don't want it like that. So got the tattoo anyway.","My mum is kinda ok with body mods. She only cares because my grandparents care about that stuff. She's helping me keep the nose piercing a secret and whenever I get sick we have an unspoken rule to never tell my grandparents. It's better for their health not to worry them but it's bad to lie.

A few years ago I was really sick and was in and out of hospital for over a year and she kept lying that I was healthy. And then when I came to visit my grandparents they didn't recognise me because of how ill I had become. Boom. Trust issues since then.

But the thing is I'm not gonna be able to hide it from my grandparents, since they have no concept of privacy, mostly my grandma though. I'm not hiding because I'm afraid of their opinion, frankly I don't really give a shit, I'm more worried that they are very old and stuff like this could be horrible for their health. But also I just don't want them to hate me because of something so trivial.",I already have a job and moving out next week. All my stuff is packed. I guess I just have to accept they'll never like me.,"Because my family are going to think it's the end of the world. They're going to think I'm in a gang doing coke. Just because of a small tattoo.

I just want advice on how I can get them to understand it's not like that at all. That I'm just me. 

They're the kind of people that think I'm a lesbian just because I like black clothes and videogames.","It's not even a big deal. I got a small 8cm tattoo. My mum won't kick me out, I move out next week anyway but there is a very real possibility my grandparents will never talk to me again or shame me for the rest of my life. I love my family but they are extremely controlling. It just sucks that my own family can't accept me for who I am. I'm tired of pretending to be a basic nice Christian girl.",Well I am a fan of some Mexican food,This is GOLD,Well imma try not to spoil cuz I wanna make a comic about her someday. But basically she used to be friends with the guy she's haunting and now she hates him and wants to ruin his life because he started dating her best friend. Uhh it gets complicated... I did publish the comic last year but since then I've improved the story.,Terrible Adam Sandler or Nick Cage films lmaooo,"It sounds like she may be hiding something and feels really paranoid about her privacy being invaded. Or she could be having some trust issues?

Me and my partner are really open with our devices, we gave ecah other our phone passwords mostly for safety reasons. Like if I'm in a an emergency situation and my phone is dead and his works then I will be able to use his device.

Mostly we share each others phones to look at pictures we've taken, we have taken so many it's a bit silly to send all 800 when we can just swap phones to look at them. Sometimes I just use my bfs phone to call my phone when I've lost it too.

I think it's unusual your partner is so defensive of her device, I know some people who are extremely private with their devices but even they don't react in such a way as your partner, accussing you of touching their stuff.

You should talk to her and ask why this is such a big deal for her. Maybe you feels like she doesn't trust you?","I have a glass door which is quite similar to that. But I don't think it's helping because he just meows at the dog through the door. Not aggressive meowing, just quiet meows which I interpret as ""I don't like this"".",I just freaked out and held down my glass jar down when the wind started to pick up a little,If you don't manage to get it out just wear a plaster/band-aid on your nose,I mix the dry food with wet food or some fancy treats and he just gobbles everything in seconds.,This guy could kill you for real.,I diagnose your cat: dog,When having sex on your period you MUST use a condom not because you'll get pregnant (pretty impossible on period) but to avoid infection for you or your partner.

That shit can really hurt.,I'll wait 5 weeks and see how it is,I've done that and it just makes it unbalanced. The picture is taken at a lower angle but from the front it looks straight.

I've built my life to be so stressful and I'm never satisfied or fulfilled.  Now it's 4am and i can't fall back asleep with all the defeatist thoughts going in circles.

By that I mean he can read insecurities off people and it came up a few times when he meets a principal or some adult and knows exactly what to say to piss them off.

Thanks in advance for the help","Ever since I read somewhere on reddit about telling your elders how much you really appreciate them while you still can, instead of waiting until it's too late, I've realized how shitty I've been about those things.  My brother and dad have always been pretty closed guys and although we're friendly and on great terms, we just don't get into intimate conversations.  

Today, while opening holiday presents, one I received was a big heavy book about comparative religion.  I'm a science guy and nobody in my family is very devout or even close, so I was very confused.  That, plus the fact that I usually take a second to look my gift over and give genuine thanks and appreciation instead of immediately spouting my surprise and joy made my dad feel really embarrassed for giving it to me.  What happened is that he got it on accident from a badly-fulfilled order online and figured he would give it to me because I might enjoy it, but when he noticed my confusion I think he got the impression that it was a stupid gift, which made me feel bad in turn for giving him that impression.

The thing is, he got me other presents.  He got me very awesome gifts and he gave me a roof over my head, and always food to eat, and sacrificed his own earnings to live in a very high property tax area to contribute to giving me a great education, and forgave me for being the shithead teenager I was, and gave me an enormous sum of money to entirely cover four years of college (no rules, no conditions, no limits, just completely trusting me), and has taught me so much about how I would want to be a dad.  

Just recently little things like his embarrassment of his present, to my mom accidentally mentioning something about his worrying that I see him as absent/neglecting because he doesn't visit often have made me realize how much he cares about our relationship and how little I've done to really show him that I acknowledge the remarkable things he's done already.  I hate feeling spoiled or ungrateful, but I just have a really hard time breaking the reputation/atmosphere of our conversations because they're always just casual. ","Tomorrow is my 90th day.  I could just fap and start doing that weekly or something, or I could just keep going and hold out for only achieving orgasm with a sexual partner. 

I never really felt like a had a porn addiction, I was occasionally ashamed to masturbate everyday, though.  I've been single for a few years and have hooked up a few times in the past three months of abstaining from masturbation, but it's hard to know how much of that success is due to NoFap.  I guess I won't lose too much if I do end up masturbating tomorrow as I haven't noticed very significant gains, although I have kind of surprised myself with what I'm capable of.  Essentially, NoFap certainly has instilled in me that genuine sex with a partner is the true goal, but it's unclear whether eliminating masturbation causes the goal to be more attainable (it obviously is more enjoyable just like any good thing you force yourself to enjoy less often).  

Has anyone else experienced this grey area/uncertainty?  ","I use a big, fluffy duvet and don't usually keep my bed made, so when I get home I hurl my phone into the heap and watch it lodge like a bullet in ballistic gel.  I found plenty of posts about the temptation of throwing a phone off a bridge, but none about this.  ","I'm about two weeks from reaching 90 days of NoFap and no porn.  I stumbled a few times, lasting five and then twelve and then thirty-four days before this current streak.  I'm confident I'll make it, but I think it'd be pretty cool to have another person going through the same thing since I don't talk about the challenge with anyone.  ","That's what I told myself sixty-two days ago and it fucking worked.  

I started NoFap out of curiosity and failed a few times in a row, but every attempt lasted longer.  First for only five days, then two weeks, then thirty-four days (which was a new personal best) and the one time I caved after that month of not masturbating was revolutionary.  Masturbating still felt good, I'm not going to lie about that, but I could not for the life of me shake the oddness that I was feeling knowing that I was just watching a computer screen.  It had changed forever and it helped me immensely in lasting these past two months.  

I had never climaxed with another person before last night and although the release might have dampened my drive, it was worth it because I now know just what I'm holding out for.  

I have no doubt in my mind I will make it this next month to ninety days, and no matter where you are in your NoFap endeavor, realize that what you're doing will benefit you spectacularly.","I live in North Davis near marketplace and right now can hear an amplified voice coming from a helicopter saying something about a missing child

**Context:**  Every day that I have Biology lecture, I sit in almost the same place and I realized that a girl in my lecture had been doing the same.  When we first ended up sitting next to each other, I asked her about information on the chalkboard because she seemed nice and I wanted to test the waters.  We talked a bit that hour, but in every class since then, the seat next to her isn't open when I get there.  

So back to the present.  I'm walking with a friend, somewhat distracted by our conversation, when my eyes meet her eyes and that split-second thing happens when two people walk towards each other on the sidewalk.  First she saw me and questioned whether or not to say anything, probably letting it depend on whether I look back or not.  I meet her eyes and take a handful of milliseconds to recognize who she is, during which time she doesn't assume that my pause means I'm planning on ignoring her, she says Hi!  Most people I know have a very short tolerance for that silent eye contact as if any pause in saying Hi has some secret meaning.  

I should disclaim, I'm not hideous, I'm not completely devoid of friends or social interaction, I'm not obsessing over getting in her pants ASAP.  Her saying hi really put a grin on my face, though.  Something about the way she said Hi or what it meant that she greeted me.

I spend the ten minutes before getting to Biology secretly hoping that the seat next to her will be open so we might talk a bit more and all the while I don't even know if she recognizes me or sees any kind of pattern.  Today, though, I got my answer.  ","I got a bunch of flats last year and although having pumps around campus made it possible to at least get to a bike shop, I've accepted that I really should have a tire iron, a spare tube or two, plus CO2 cartridges or a small pump with me.  It's not a pricey bundle, but the whole point of the safety backup is null if it's likely to get stolen.  Do any of you use saddle bags for whatever reason, and do you find that they remain intact?  I live off campus so the bike won't be on campus more than a fraction of the day like most people.  Thanks  "
SomethingWitty5972,"The kind of anxiety that I’m feeling right now, the fear that I won’t be myself under the medication anymore is killing me. I’ve seen many therapists and this is their recommendation and after being so unhappy for so long here I am ready to try it, everything’s done and I fully understand that this is the right next step and everything. I just feel like shit for needing it for some reason. I’m so nervous and i feel like I can’t tell anyone about it. I just cried and sang Ben Platt’s Bad Habit in my mind to anyone that I could think of: my mom, my brother, my best friend and the guy I’m seeing. After all that I sang it to myself, “Can I lean on you?” That was still a no, I finally sang it to my past me, that little girl that thought she could do anything, that she could reach the stars and deserved only the best, that girl that thought she could make a difference and help others, and I sobbed for her. Then, I prayed to nothing cause I’m not a believer, but I prayed and asked that I can do these things for myself and that I can help others and be so damn kind to anyone that needs it. I prayed that I can say what people want to hear when they need it and  be there for everyone that needs it. I’m gonna distract myself till I’ll take the meds, for the first time tomorrow. I am gonna take them. I am gonna try them. I’m  doing it for myself. It’s not wrong.

And then, I actually do that thing I’m supposed to do and it doesn’t seem like the end of the world anymore. I’m tired of having to narrate in my mind everything I have to do or I’m doing so my brain doesn’t get overwhelmed. I have to think one thing at a time. And then, I find myself thinking about all kinds of problems and how I’m gonna have to resolve them when I’m only making breakfast or something. So I try to focus in what I’m doing and leave that problem for when I have to actually deal with it. The thing is that I’m tired of doing all of this. I do this trying to control my brain until it breaks down again and I miss work and school and I embarrass myself again and then i have to go back and pick up the pieces. I quit college because I was overwhelmed and I feel lazy and stupid. Is this anxiety? I feel like my brain won’t let me live. I’ve called so many psychologists and they’re so busy right now. None of them answer. And I go about like ok, I can do this on my own and then, I breakdown at work and repeat the circle again.

But I actually like to be an example to the girls. Things are changing, I shouldn’t have to wear make up if I don’t want to.",Thanks! I’m going to try to take it easy.,"I teach 3rd-6th grade social studies. We’ve been working remotely for about a month and I feel my mental health declining rapidly. My stress and anxiety levels are of the charts. I just finished my “morning cry”. I don’t even mind teaching through Google Meets but prerecording my classes is hell for me and that’s how the school I work at wants them so the kids can see them at any time. I really suck, I lose my line of thought so many times and I struggle with giving them too much work or too little for home. I know the situation is very difficult for everyone and I don’t want to make it harder for them and the parents. So much contact with the parents is killing me, I do this because I like teaching to kids they’re funny and imaginative while the parents can be so difficult. The Director can be a pain too. She’s watching our recorded classes and making comments and I know it’s supposed to be a helpful hand but it’s just getting on my nerves “try and be more like this” “don’t say that” “try and look pretty” “stand up from the chair”. I’m not saying she’s not right but she doesn’t acknowledge the huge effort I’m making as it is. Waking up in the morning and showing up is huge already. Being able to send my classes everyday is like a miracle these days and I know this isn’t the way I should be teaching, I know I should try and do better but geez it’s difficult. It’s not like I want to be mediocre at this. So this week, she also made a poll for the parents in which they’ll say which class is doing better, which one’s giving out too much work, or which one sucks and stuff. I’m trembling on my knees and now we’re gonna discuss all that this Friday in a faculty meeting. Coincidently, this Friday’s also my birthday which is stressful as it is. I think I might actually break down at the meeting if I go. I’m actually thinking about quitting. This is too hard and taking a huge toll on me. I just wanna sleep till this is all over.","This week is my birthday. I really hate my birthday, I remember last year going to my car to cry during my lunch break. I felt like shit, it broke me a bit, being that sad and anxious. Now, I’m here, I turn 23 this Friday. Anxiety paralyzes me and makes me really unproductive and it worries me. This Friday there’s also an employee meeting and I’m honestly thinking about skipping it. It’s only gonna add more negative feelings into my birthday. And the fact is that I could probably break down crying in the middle of it. I feel like it’s too much. My mind’s running, the closer I get to the day the worse it gets. I should be working now and I just wanna cry or sleep and wake up Saturday after my birthday is over. Any advice on how to calm down? Is it normal to hate my birthday so much? I just wanna cry and sleep.","Seriously, tho. Help.","Ay least for me, teaching has been a nightmare and we just basically started. I hate teaching to a camera and how many times my line of thought disappears and how boring I sound. I am depressed since before and I am anxious. But I used to do this for the kids cause they’re happy and curious and fun to listen to. Now I send a lame class through a video where I look dead. I don’t know if I’m doing this right. I don’t know if they’re learning anything. And every comment on it comes from the director or from the parents and I don’t give a fuck about any of them. I’m sorry I’m just pissed. Every comment makes me wanna kill myself. I’ve never been very happy or expressive or extroverted and this recording of myself is so tiring to me. They want me to wear make up and act happy and I just feel so fucking lame. I hate it. I want it to stop so bad. Everything is shit rn and this is one of those days that I wished I could quit and stay home. That’s probably the depression talking but it just feels like so much work rn and so little compensation and it doesn’t really matter if I wanna be dead anyway. I am getting professional help btw. It’s just shit so it doesn’t work. I’m already home AFTER work hours and I can’t help but keep thinking about it, about I could’ve done a better job, I’m probably the worst at this. Try doing it like this or try doing like that is killing me. And I don’t even know how to get it out of my mind.",Thanks! I don’t intend to ghost him. I just have the fear that if the conversations goes towards that topic too hard I might do it. Or I might tell him I’m uncomfortable with the conversation in which case he’ll still know and I’ll still feel like shit. I know I am overthinking as usual. I’m gonna try my best. I really like him.,"I (f22) don’t wanna tell him (m22) that I’m a virgin. We’ve been talking for about a month and we’ve shared a few things but that is like my shamefullest secret and I don’t wanna tell him. But I know it’ll keep coming up. I’m not one to have these hard uncomfortable conversations. I’m more of a runner and that’s probably why I’m still a virgin lol. Seriously a part of me just wants to ghost him and never tell him or lie. But he’ll know. Also, what if I just don’t feel comfortable telling him yet? Do you think this is something that he has to know now? We haven’t talked about seriously like “doing” it. We haven’t even gotten on a date yet. Like what? Can I keep the secret a little while longer? Or am I dragging him on or something?",He hasn’t. I just thought it would’ve been awkward after plus I was overreacting. It’s been good lately. We talked honestly about it and moved on with jokes and other stuff. What I wrote before came out of those negative thoughts and emotions I was having.,"Thank you, I guess I wrote out of those same negative feelings. I’ll work on them.","I (f22) have been talking with a guy (m22) for three weeks. That is a lot for me because I don’t like anyone. Ever. I’m a cynic, I don’t believe in anything more less in relationships. And I never thought that I’d enjoy talking to someone this much. And today I was pissy and insecure and more depressed than usual and I made a few shitty comments. Like, first, I complimented him cause I was in my feels and then I felt so stupid after saying something nice that I had to start fucking with it. He had complimented me back and I started to make fun of all of it and he was like “sorry” and I felt like shit. I started to explain that it wasn’t him that I was just feeling insecure and I tried being super honest but I feel like I just kept worsening everything. At some point he was like ‘wow, first ever discussion’ like fight or whatever which actually made me feel worse and I cried a bit. I told him I was sorry and asked if I could fix it and he was super nice and said that that was just me rn and he accepted whatever and that everything was good. So I told him I felt undeserving of all of that and that I was grateful and he asked if something had happened and I just told him to tell me about his day cause clearly I’ve talked enough. I keep sounding like I’m the queen of the pity party and I’m just trying to calm down and think about everything well. Idk what else to do. Maybe I’m too depressed to keep talking with him but I don’t really want to stop either. But I don’t wanna fuck everything up in a way that’ll leave us feeling hateful towards each other and I really like him. I still don’t believe in relationships but maybe I’d like to look back to and dedicate the one that got away to him.",You’ve been very helpful. Thanks!,"I get the cynical heart, I am the same way myself. I’ve never been slim so yeah, all the pictures he’s seen of me are basically this same way. During quarantine time I have gained weight, which I already loss with that month of workouts I did. I have kept sending pictures here and there of my face with filters and some without and he has never said anything about it. He works out and he knows I do so too. But while he works out to put on weight and muscle I’ve told him I do it to lose the weight. He also made a comment about not eating while depressed and I said I was the opposite. I think, I’ve been truthful enough and I also kinda know that I might be being irrational and that nobody’s perfect. I might not even get to meet him at all! Idk, I’ve also shared with him that I’m crazy insecure and that I can’t always control it. Writing this I realize there’s not much else I could do. Thanks!",I think I should lose 20 pounds before meeting him. I like him a lot but I usually go for guys that are heavy like me so that I don’t feel so bad. I know it’s wrong but it’s an insecurity I can’t seem to pass. I’ve actually been working out recently and feeling good about myself until I hurt a knee and now I feel going back to being a fat potato. I keep talking to him but I really don’t want to lead him on if I’m not going to actually meet with him.,Thanks! We’ll probably do that soon!!!,"I don’t want to be rude, ungrateful or insensitive. I am grateful that COVID hasn’t touched our family and close friends and I feel deeply for those who have. This situation is tough and I’m just commenting a bit on my side of things while still being aware of everything. I just “met” this guy (22) I (22) like and it’s usually almost impossible for me to actually like someone. I don’t date, I just talk through dating apps with guys who want to be friends or just talk to some guys for a few days and that’s that. But this guy, I like and he’s talked about doing something out maybe. Recently, where we live almost everything is closing. No dine in restaurants, no beaches, cinemas, bars, anything of the sort. Also, I wouldn’t like us to put each other’s family at risk. He works at a pharmacy! I don’t think either of us is a video call person and we could call and talk but I think everybody at home would hear me talking on the phone. Ok, so I know I’ve been kinda whining the whole time but I guess my question is what else could we do? I guess maybe we’d talk on the phone some time soon, but how do we make it different, kinda? Sorry for the little rant and thanks!","Ive never been in an actual relationship and I have a lot of insecurities about it. I honestly, don’t believe in anything permanent so I logically never go for it. I should also mention that I’m actually struggling a lot right now, I am depressed and very anxious, I’m at a very low point in my life in which I feel very unaccomplished and undeserving of love. But I have been trying really hard lately to try my all, I’ve been doing some changes (I understand I still need professional help and I have set an appointment and been to a few but it’s really difficult where I live to get great help, let’s put it that way and with COVID and all...) I have been working out and I have been trying to get more social so I’ve been trying dating apps and it’s not the first time. Anyway, I purposely only talk “seriously” with guys that only want to be friends cause relationships scare me. But a few weeks back, I started talking with this guy that I actually like and he might like me. He’s funny so I’m never bored talking with and he can listen and be nice too. Im actually for the first time enjoying talking with a guy in a long long time. I always used to try and talk to guys because it was the “normal” thing to do. I’m hating myself over all this. I don’t want to like anyone. I don’t think anything could last. I don’t think he’ll actually like me. I don’t know what to do, I’ll either find a way to dislike him or just friendzone him because that’s the only thing I know how to do. I can only talk to him as a friend cause I don’t know any better, he’s gonna get bored and I’m gonna get hurt. I can see myself overthinking but idk what to do. I understand maybe this is normal in the dating world and people feel like this regularly, but I don’t. How do I put my insecurities to the side and give him a chance? How do I act to not friendzone him? 

TL; DR Insecure girl needs help on how not to friendzone the first guy she likes in a long while.","I purposely only talk to boys that only want to be friends. We just talk a bit and that’s it. But with this guy is different and I’m hating myself over it. I like him,  he’s really funny and I’m never bored with him, but he can also be nice and listen. I’m just waiting for the other shoe to drop and I’ll be able to dislike him so I don’t have to go through this. Or maybe I’ll friendzone him cause that’s what i always do. I don’t know how to treat him as other than a friend anyway. I don’t know what else to do. In a month I’ll be helping him text another woman or something cringey like that. I can feel myself overthinking so hard.","It’s not like I would mind, I mean I have thought about since before I met him. But I don’t want to seem “desperate or something. We just met and we’ve been texting for a few days and he just suggested I watched them. But I’m not usually one to comply and also, I think that he should watch something I want him to, too. I don’t think he would cause that’s not his type, I think. So I’m afraid of asking. How do I approach it IF I did watch them? Idk","Everyday’s the same and it’s killing me. I’m so deeply depressed that I can’t stand it anymore. I’ve tried so many things but just so anxious and mad and tired! And these last few weeks?! The world is horrible! Everything brings me down and I’m tired of trying to look for a silver lining, a way out, a coping mechanism that actually makes me forget. But I am overwhelmed by the horrible people right now, by the many ways I could be spending my time like painting or crocheting or cooking or dieting or working out or reading a book or watching a show. I don’t know what to fix right now, where to start. I wake up I eat and I fall asleep again. I wanna run away, I don’t wanna make it to September but I wanna see my brother grow. But honestly, I’ve lost all interest on my own life. I don’t think I’ll ever feel better, look better or be better. I don’t wanna finish studying or start working. I don’t wanna be me. I’m not anyone right now, I stopped being myself a long time ago, this is a fucking ghost of who I used to be. I hate myself so deeply."

mrjsinthehouse,I'm on this subreddit and i always see people post that they want to feel pain so they cut themselves.  I feel like I'm alone in this because I don't want to feel anything.

Pat_Robi,"I started high school with a 3.8 GPA. I ended with a 2.7 GPA. I gave up and told myself that I'd be fine and I was so wrong. I'm 21 and all of my friends (not exaggerating) are in college or the military and know what they're doing with their lives. I have no job and no purpose in life. Everyday feels like hell trying to climb out of this stupid depressive hole that I've been in for almost 4 years now. I promise you, though, I am a lot better than I was in high school. I could've been even better if I had at least kept my grades up, but I didn't. You're so young, and I'm sure you hear that a lot, but its true. Start talking to your social worker at school. I saw mine all four years and I still use the advice that she gave me. Don't push away advice, even if it sounds cliché or dumb. It really helps.","At the end of the day, its your decision. I wish you the best.","I totally understand that. At a certain point, you just get so tired of trying to help them. Honestly, you should leave to better yourself. That initial break up is so hard to do, but I promise you that everything will feel so much easier.","I love watching lesbian porn, but I'm not gay. The porn he watches is just something that turns him on, but that doesn't mean he would actively participate in it. Also, no, not a fuckboy. If you want to find out if he's really into dudes too, then ask him yourself. He could also just be bisexual. 🤷🏻‍♀️","I always found that relationships can't really work unless both people are happy with the other. If you find you're not happy because of her, then you should leave before things get worse and you find yourself back in the same hole. You're not an asshole for feeling this way, but I don't think you should outright tell her why you're wanting to take a break. Just say that things are starting to feel tense for you and you know she's having a hard time too. Best of luck to you.","Honestly, just end it there. I could tell just by reading this that you're not into him all that much after discovering this part of him. Leading further into a relationship would just complicate your feelings.","I left mine. We were together for 3 years and I loved him with all my heart, but everytime he complained, I offered a solution. He turned it down everytime, as if he liked the pity. Eventually, I decided I didn't want to have to take care of him. Relationships need to work both ways in order to function. Your happiness should come first, so if you find yourself questioning your happiness, just leave. You'll feel a lot less weight on your shoulders when you do.",That was actually very beautiful. Thank you very much for your feedback!,"My partner (m19) and I (f20) have been best friends for almost 7 years now. We've been through everything together and have stuck by each others sides in the toughest of times. Recently, we both admitted to having feelings for each other (which we've both been holding in for forever) and decided to start dating. Ever since this started, he's managed to help me through seeing myself as something other than ugly (He's such a dream).

He's fucking phenomenal! He's so good with finances and time management. He's incredibly fit and constantly working on bettering himself. Essentially, he is the epitome of perfect.

I feel like the complete opposite. I don't have a car (recently died) or a job (place I was working at closed) and I never make efforts to better myself. I'm not very fit either. I feel so incredibly inferior and sick to my stomach when I think about how he's probably not looking at the real me.

I just feel like I don't deserve him at all and I should just let him go so he can live a better life with someone else. He says he loves me and he's always there when my brain starts throwing sad thoughts around.

I guess I don't really have a question, I just want to know if anyone else has ever felt this way. Are you still with that person?

TL;DR
My boyfriend is perfect and I am absolutely nowhere near. Why is he still here?",stevenuniverse.xyz,"Well it's not everyday and I don't ever talk like that. I just let him know I'm crushing, but I never describe the crush in anyway. I don't ever want him to feel like he needs to become whatever I find attractive on another person. I think I may share too much and it only makes his insecurities grow.","I'm usually the one that brings it up. I'll let him know what's going on in my head and that'll lead to a conversation of him asking if I'm still attracted to him and if I'm going to cheat on him. Sometimes I think that maybe I shouldn't bring it up, but I just want to be honest with him if I'm crushing on someone.","No, we're both from the U.S.","Well it depends on how serious the thing is. What did he lie about, if you don't mind me asking?",I do think we need to come to an understanding with each other as well. Thank you!,I think it is at that point where we really take the time to sit down and have a long discussion on our passions and goals. Thank you very much!,"I really appreciate the feedback. I'll keep in mind that last part. Its not something I really want to do, but I know its something I really might have to do. Thanks!","So my bf and I are both 20 and still living at home. Whenever we start to transition into talking about our future family life, everything is smooth and we agree on practically everything (how many kids, when to get married, what kind of house and where, etc.).

When we discuss how we're going to get to that point, it always turns into an arguement. He currently has a full-time job that he loves, but swears it's not what he wants to do in life (He wants to do IT). I have a part-time job and I'm about to go back to school for my teaching degree.

He says that I should consider getting a full-time job because I'll have more money to save up. I tell him that my family is very giving and understanding, so they're alright with me living here for another year or two while I save. He says that I need to start thinking about my future more. I tell him my plans to work and go to some classes (I can't afford to go to school full-time, so I'll do a couple classes a semester).

He continues to throw different scenarios at me until I no longer have a solid answer. Then he says something like, ""See? This is why you need to start working more and making more money.""

I will also add that I do play a negative part in these arguements as I poke at the fact that he doesn't have time to go back to school. I make negative comments towards his lack of motivation to get the certifications he constantly talks about going back to get. 

It seems we're always at each other's throats whenever we discuss our work/plans. How can I handle this situation better the next time this discussion arises? Other than this one aspect, our relationship is very solid.

TL;DR
Bf and I are arguing about each other's work/school plans. We only argue on this topic and we say some pretty rude things to each other. How should we handle it next time?","True. Foreplay isn't really important in a quicky either. I mean, there's always personal faves that you can go back to. For example, missionary isn't a boring position, but it is the easiest. Because of this, it tends to be the go-to. After a while, you wanna start in a different position (doggy, cowgirl, etc.), but then you do that for a while and it gets boring too. Suddenly, missionary is your go-to again and it's way better than you remember it. The cycle continues til the end of time. Foreplay, for me, is the same!","Foreplay is so important, but gets boring if it's the same foreplay every time. Spice it up!",Reminds me of Catra from She Ra,"Have you considered an open relationship? Getting to go out and live the single life while also loving each other. You're still dating and in love, but you feel a lot more free. I know a lot of people feel like it may not be ideal, but you don't know unless you try. If it comes to a point where you've tried everything, but nothing is getting rid of this itch, then it may be time to just call it quits and leave each other for good. I've felt this itch before as well. My bf and I aren't in an open relationship, but we've discussed it. He said he just wouldn't be able to deal with the jealousy that comes with sharing and I agreed, so we're still living in our little vanilla world! I wouldn't have it any other way.

TL;DR
Discuss different solutions to this problem. If you can't come to an agreement, it's probably best to split.",This is the way.,Solved!,"For now I'll just say solved, because I really can't find anything other than Blue Spring Ride.

The anime was a romantic one. The scene was the guy telling the girl not to follow him. Of course, she follows him and ends up in a bad neighborhood and he's smoking with his friends. He gets angry because they're making fun of the girl, so he grabs her arm and takes her back to the station. I can't remember their names, but I think the guy had black hair.

I saw this one a couple years back, so I'm sorry if there's not a while lot of detail there."

About a month ago she contacted me and said she had to leave because she couldn’t take being heartbroken, but, she also felt like telling me she was dating someone new. That’s cool, because so was I, and I was actually living with someone.

MyWayoftheNinja,"I was depressed like crazy during college. My family is preety conservative so I was in self denial that I was depressed and never really got treatment for it. I started university in 2006 and finally got medication maybe in 2010.

I remember going to starbucks on campus in my second year and hating whenever this japanese girl would serve me. I thought she hated me as she acted different whenever I went, in my depressed state I though everyone hated me, when in reality my coldness and keeping away from others, they probably thought that I was cold. I think that girl actually liked me, not hated me, which is why she was behaving ackwardly with me.

12 years have passed since then and I regret what my life could have been if I weren't so depressed, if didn't have social anxiety and if I wasn't a coward. I wonder where this girl is now, probably back in Japan as she was a international student and living her life.

While me at 32 I am rotting away. My head seems like its slowing down by the day. Its odd, all these years I was unaware of anything, I matured late, maybe 2 years ago now, at 30 and actually noticing each and every day in vivid detail. I now know more about the feelings and struggles of a single week, then I did in the whole my life till now.  I grew up in poverty, my mom supported us working at Mcdonalds and my parents would have awful fights. I wonder how much and perhaps if that stunted my maturity.

My mom also had people always abandon her. My dad more or less abandoned her and went overseas. My oldest brother and firstborn became a murdurer amd spent time in prison. As a result my mom was scared of losing us, she taught me to always beware of women amd avoid them, so I became socially retarded.

Now every passing moment I regret, one more second means that I am one second further from some better moment in my past.

Imagine starting walking on a road. Take for example this girl I saw 12 years ago. My average annual travel distance just by car is 11,000 km per year. That means in 12 years , I am still at the start line, and she has walked 30 times the distance between my location and mexico.

waspoppinsusan,"Well I don’t have the best advice, all I can say is you’re not alone. Sometimes knowing there’s others who understand can help. I’ve dropped out multiple times as well and failed so many classes due to depression and it’s hard to explain to people who don’t deal with this but that’s what depression does. It takes all your motivation and skews things to make life look so hopeless. Like others have said, don’t be hard on yourself, you can always restart no matter how many times it takes. There was one semester where I was really struggling so the next I took one class and I’ve taken two classes a different semester and it helped me make some progress. What helps me is hanging out with people to help me distract myself and I like to read and listen to music. Find the things you do enjoy. I know that might be hard because depression even kills interest in the things you do like but don’t isolate yourself. Try to stay active.

Did this happen to you? I go to the toilet and it’s just random bursts of clear fluid but not very much so I go multiple times. I’m worried I’ll have liquid inside tomorrow.

Sounds interesting to read,"I have a question, I’ve been dealing with weird sensations during a BM and I stumbled upon rectal prolapse. I’d say aside from hemorrhoids it looks pretty normal but I’d a rectal prolapse always visible externally of can it be internal ?","I have to disagree with “they’re probably right”. The majority of doctors are lazy to be thorough and simply don’t care. That’s been my experience at least. I’ve gone twice to a GI specialist and a colorectal specialist and both times they’ve not taken me seriously and told me to eat fiber and both times I’ve had to suggest to get a colonoscopy. It’s ridiculous how all those years of training they have for them to tell you to just eat fiber. I remember I had chills, pains, nausea and finally vomiting/diarrea to the point I was passing out and the GI nurse told me it was normal. I felt she was mocking me with that stupid response.","I’m glad I came to read this sub. I’ve been dealing with GI problems and these doctors get on my nerves. I’ve been told twice by 2 different doctors to just take fiber. Like no shit, google told me that and so did my common sense.

I don’t know if I have IBS or something else and I’m getting a colonoscopy in a few days but I need your advice. I have noticed that when I have a BM, at the end no matter the texture, something always gets stuck so I have to sit there until everything is out and that takes like an hour which has caused me hemorrhoids. I initially thought that the hemorrhoids were blocking the passage but when I was checked he told me I had no visible internal hems and to “just change my habits”. Like wtf is that supposed to mean. I don’t enjoy being stuck on the toilet. If I don’t wait til it all comes out it’s never ending wiping. It doesn’t make sense bc I’ve felt them and he just said it was a flare up, IDK anymore.

It’s totally possible.,Thank you for the info. Super helpful. I’ll definitely ask the doctor for lyrica instead since you mentioned absorption problems. Do you think lyrica alone would help the pain of that surgery? I’m thinking it might depend on the dose too...
RWDS_Ron,"I know some people might disagree but one of the things I'd start with would be trying to stay away from pot as it can really fuck your mind when you're in a constant negative state already, I lived through that experience and quitting definitely helped improve myself. Regarding the death of your friend there is not much I can say unfortunately. I lost my girlfriend to leukemia when I was 15 and a friend of mine through a train accident and the only thing that helps is knowing that this horrible feeling of loss and grief will go eventually, most likely to a point where you manage to live normal again but never really leave your mind. Apart from that the old stories anyone would tell you: talk with someone close to you, maybe even a stranger who you can open up yourself to or a family member. My recommendation would be, and I know it probably sounds silly, play videogames. You never believe how much impact they can have on your mind until you try it. My recommendations would be skyrim, the fallout franchise or older bioware games (mass effect trilogy, dragon age origins, star wars kotor). 

And lastly, no matter how tempting it might be, never give in. I know how much that feeling of wanting to die is crushing down on you right now but you can't give up. I can't force you to not do it and honestly I don't want to, it needs to come from yourself. But I can tell you that you will feel better, your going to find new things in life worth living for, a partner you can life your life with, a hobby and so many other opportunities. Please think about it.

And your sexuality shouldn't even be up for discussion. Who you love is your own damn business don't let anyone let you think your not normal for being homosexual.","Did you play it near release?

HereLiesJoe,"I don't know if I want anyone to see this or not, and in all likelihood I won't leave it up, I just don't have anyone to talk to anymore and I need to get things out of my head. My best friend left me, which in hindsight seems inevitable, but she made me believe we had a real future together, and she was basically the only thing I had to live for, to look forward to. I love her so much and now I'm alone, and a part of me is gone with her, maybe the best part.

I understand why she had to do it, I'm a pretty shitty person to be around, and frankly I was probably dragging her down with me. And maybe a better person would just be happy for her, and able to move on because it's what she needed. But how am I supposed to get through life alone, without any single spark of joy or hope? And how do you live with knowing you're a detriment to the lives of the people you care about the most? At least by being her friend I could feel like there was someone who was marginally better off for my existing, but it's the opposite.

In theory, anyway","What? No I'm talking about Master Roshi. Yeah he's considered a perv, but it's sort of shrugged off because he's an old man, and the whole thing is seen as just a joke rather than anything serious. These aren't innocent actions, and they aren't made suddenly ok because they happen to a 'strong' woman rather than a stereotypical victim. And let's not forget Bulma was 16 when he coerced her into flashing him in the original series. The same thing is true for Jiraiya in Naruto, although I don't think it's as severe. It's not that it's portrayed as positive, but it is laughed off as a mild, even innocent, personality defect, rather than something really fucked for which they should honestly be in jail. While I'm confident there are examples I could draw on in other Shounen anime, like I said I don't really watch that much","I wouldn't say I've watched a great deal of anime, but shows like dbz for instance are really fucking creepy in how they play off sexual harassment/assault for laughs","It's a 'run-on' sentence; I'm sorry, but your comment is completely illegible.","I can't bring myself to enjoy this game, it just seems cruel to everyone involved","I'm pretty sure it's not, like it's mainly used to mean cool I think, or at least that's my experience",Repeatedly empty your bin on the ground and refill it for infinite nudes,"Holy shit thanks, I didn't even know I could do that",Isn't that just a suit?

There are always going to be times your preferred hero is less viable if you're invested in playing one in particular, even disregarding the nature of team balance and meta comps","It's interesting, I'd always heard the term 'conservative estimate' as being the opposite of 'liberal estimate,' i.e. potentially underestimating vs. potentially overestimating. And while some online dictionaries support this (without alternative definition) some just have the definition you were talking about regarding caution. Cambridge English Dictionary has a separate 'Business English' definition to that effect, but it's not just business because it looks like it's used in risk management, and sometimes in science to evaluate a worst-case scenario. 

That's not just regarding time though, even if that's the only context that applies to you, so I'm not sure where the distinction of context lies in terms of your definition against mine. There may be variation in terms of colloquial use vs. business/academic use, or perhaps there are regiona differences, or one may be growing more common with time, or if it's simply an annoying word with potentially opposite meanings based on the intention of the user. I still don't think the way it was used above is incorrect as such, but I wouldn't be confident in saying the way you used it was either (anymore).","'A conservative estimate or guess is one in which you are cautious and estimate or guess a low amount which is probably less than the real amount.' - Collins English Dictionary

Some people may have experienced the situation as sexually charged, others wouldn't think twice about it. I don't think it's that implausible that OP's girlfriend didn't see anything wrong with it, and hadn't considered that he might. Either hadn't given it a second thought because it was such a non-issue to her, or had assumed incorrectly that he'd see it the same.

And within eating disorders you still have Binge Eating Disorder. Both the DSM and ICD seem to just refer to mental/behavioural disorders when talking about mental health issues, I'm not sure if 'mental illness' is its own official term in psychiatry at all, or if it's just used colloquially. I definitely can't find anywhere that distinguishes between a mental disorder or a mental illness - the only place I see the terms together they're listed as interchangeable

Edit: actually, tacked onto that, I completely forgot that the mental illness people usually refer to when they say depression is Major Depressive Disorder. And anxiety disorders also fall under the bracket of what you'd probably consider mental illness too, so I'm not sure the definition of 'disorder' you're going by is really commonly accepted","Is that actually an official definition though? Tons of things that are labelled disorders you'd definitely also call mental illnesses, and are curable, like eating disorders, or BDD. Mental disorder and mental illness seem interchangeable in psychiatry, from what I can find. Likewise, I can't really find any definition that states an illness has to be curable to be defined as such.","Was it not reclassified from Gender Identify Disorder to Gender Dysphoria?

It's like kicking someone in the balls and then offering them paracetemol.","I agree that the solution isn't a return to a primitivist way of life tbf, although I do still maintain that this is the means of existence that is most in tune with our nature. However, the world we live in today is such that we this is neither practical nor desirable. The real question though is this, could we and should we reshape our existences so that we live more in accordance with nature, and to what extent should we even consider doing this?

I'm also interested in hearing your perspective on the ethics of technology, I think we are collectively aware of the benefits but I believe that there are negatives too. For example, Facebook was originally created to allow men on Harvard's campus to rate the attractiveness of women, which in itself caused distress to some women who were rated negatively. However it then evolved into a mainstream technology which was designed to allow family and friends to keep virtually connected, even if they lived apart. The problem with it is that it didn't consider the importance of genuine, face to face social relations with people, and that people would judge the quality of their lives relative to others using the platform as a metric. This also meant that many people would only put up the best snapshots and instances of their lives, which causes psychological distress because they were deceiving themselves as to how good their lives actually are.

But my main concern with technology is that it is increasingly making us dependent and reliant on this dreadful political system, and as we become increasingly alienated from the means to which we can get food, shelter, clothing etc without relying on the technology being used by the system to produce them, we will essentially become completely powerless. Is the solution then to properly democratise technology so that it serves our interests, or should we instead treat it with skepticism?",I think the fact that we all live in the knowledge that we could be evicted if we can no longer pay our rent or mortgage makes us understand that the state has a monopoly on the use of force and violence. Ironically though the best case scenario is to be in state owned rented accommodation (at least in the UK) because of the added protections and greater difficulty with evictions. But the system essentially thrives on us living in a state of psychological fear that we could lose our homes if we fail to dance to its toxic tune.,"All that for a maximum of $9800 a year!

I have long suffered with mental health conditions, and for a long time I thought there was something 'wrong' with me. But for some time now, I have begun to suspect that the issue is actually with the society we all live in. I read a really interesting article entitled '[This is your brain on neoliberalism](https://neweconomics.org/2020/10/this-is-your-brain-on-neoliberalism)', and it (among other readings) made me realise that many of my problems can be put down to the fear/stress state my mind is being put into due to the poisonous socio-economic system we live in. I also believe that a large part of the problem is that we are essentially designed to be nomadic hunter gatherers, living in a system which relies on our financial dependence. I don't really know what the solution is, I think a universal basic income would at least mean that we don't have to rely on soul crushing wage slavery just to make ends meet, but ideally we would return to an existence that we were evolutionary designed for.

I am graduating from Georgia Tech this semester with an undergrad in biomedical engineering. I have been a tutor for over 4 years, yes I know tutoring and teaching are different, but I've discovered that what I really, truly enjoy is the feeling of teaching someone something new. Plus I am a people person and thrive off of social energy. Anyways I guess that's my way of saying that I wish to become an educator. 

But alas, I have been exploring the world of teaching and it is incredibly overwhelming, so many different people saying so many different things about how to become an educator. I wish to teach math and science (biology, chemistry, physics) in K-12 environments. I considered TEFL but it seems that would be a waste of time given my actual goal of teaching STEM in K-12 schools. Something I wish to avoid is teaching in private schools or in wealthy districts. As an activist this is actually very important to me, I need to be immersed in the working class. Given that I am graduating soon, I wish to start teaching as soon as I can and also obtain my teaching certificate through a good program. Something that concerns me is the prospect of being tied down to a certain location for too long but perhaps continuity is actually a good thing. 

What I would appreciate advice on is: what are some good options for both obtaining a teaching license from a good program while also being able to work a job? Any particular programs that y'all would recommend? I wish to eventually teach internationally, or perhaps do that as soon as I can, what are some considerations if I am planning long term for that? Do different countries have better teaching certification programs?

mjkjx34,I can relate to you,I agree....What I hate the most is when I am waiting for a bus and its raining AND someone is smoking so I cant get away from them cause I will get wet....hate that,Oh shit....you are right...oh well,Obviously.... You live closer to it but for me where I live difference is 30ms,"BioShock
34",Are you fucking kidding me????? You live in Africa and you have 135 ms in WEST EUROPE???????? Then your internet is not that bad as you say...Why dont you play EUNE or something closer.....smh ...... 135 IN EUW......Seems like you are not telling the truth,You just ended him,Kossovo is not a country.....yet.....If something ever happens between Belgrade and Pristina,I agree dude. I just want you to know that not all of Europe is rich or the First World....but even where I live is better than where you live and I feel the same way just not as bad as you....I live in a 2nd world country but yeah kinda puts things in perspective,Yeah I agree some jokes can hurt but nothing that will last too long. What I have problem with is that this post says if you are skinny and someone says you should gain weight you feel hurt. Like someone says hey dude you need to eat more and then you start crying and go on reddit saying it hurts you like WTF...That isnt hurtful at all.....Why would you feel hurt ???? Also saying someone needs to lose weight isnt bad at all....Its for their health......I dont get it,Actually I am skinny and people did say a lot of things to me but I dont care about them.... And I sure as hell dont whine about it on social media cause I dont get offended so easily... People just want an excuse to feel opressed and whine about it jesus christ grow up... It isnt fun I know that and I have been bullied a lot of times but so what.. But maybe I am like this cause I am from Russia but yeah....I need to gain weight so I dont get offended when someone tells me I need to do that and also fat people need to lose weight....Now if someone has anorexia they need help and people shouldnt make fun of them,Well ok..... It just pisses me off that people get offended so easily..... First world luxury I guess... Smh,I guess.... But why dont just tell them that you literally cant gain weight... Surely then they will stop,"Sorry guys but why the fuck are you all such spoiled snowflakes. People tell me I should gain weight and it doesnt hurt me at all. Jesus fucking Christ why you get offended so easily. Gonna get downvoted probably.... 

.",What?? Shut up mate,Germans hated Jews and Slavs but its not a color thing. They all have white skin... So i dont get this meme,Wait..... Dont Jews have white skin?? Idk,I guess you are right...I was kinda making things bigger....Its a first world country after all......Oh and I am glad that he wasnt expelled or whatever,Thats kinda weird....Its racist in both ways..I dont know Am not American,Shut up dude its a joke....If you think over JUST ONE FUCKING WORD family should starve to death then you are a cunt......Even if he said it 10 times ......Someones feelings are not more important than a persons life....Now I dont think thats right but over 1 fucking word that is crazy...Maybe I dont get this cause I am not an American,Can confirm.......,Its always Americans like WTF.....,I dont get it,Only in America can you end up homeless over 1 word
Killacamm_,"I’ll be 23 in January and I’ve wasted my whole life no license no money no high school diploma . Years of Trauma being in foster care system as a child no one to show me unconditionally love . Being in a shelter at 18 . I’d be homeless if it weren’t for my girlfriend taking care of me the past few years I’m so sad everyday my thoughts constantly screaming at me . Can barely write this post because I’m so down , my brain is screwed can’t think or barely even function can’t remember anything  , don’t wanna get outta bed just eat all day . I also have tension headaches gerd and costo . I think I’m just gonna die young and never even see my thirty or 40s I just want the pain to ended but it too far gone I’ve never been happy for a long period of time . And I think my brain as hade enough doesn’t even feel like I’m alive just a ghost walking around . I stay in my room all day don’t like to be around my girls family I think they all hate me because I stay there rent free . I’m physically exhausted and emotionally. I’m a grosss fat fuck and I’m a pussy I hate myself and I hate my life I don’t even care if I die or live anymore","So it’s possible I could have both as well , and this isn’t the first time I’ve heard of people with costo master get cancer . So who knows it’s actually unrelated because that inflammation in the body for years those bad cells like that definitely is the underlying issue with Major dessert like cancer , today my boob is very tender and I wouldn’t know if I have a lump of not because I don’t know how to identify it .",I meant pancreatic * cancer just didn’t know how to spell it,do you have breast cancer ? And costo or I’m confused,It’s actually a relief you said that because I’m thinking same thing maybe it’s costo but My costo hasn’t barely bothered me in a month or  more and even when I did have a flare up I wasn’t experiencing breast pain . And it’s in my right boob just constantly sharp running pains,"I’m I getting better or just stable , it’s been about two weeks since my last chest tightness I haven’t hade a flare up since the first two weeks I hade costo I’ve hade it for about two months now . Is it normal to not get flare ups ? Now all I feel is when I first wake up my bones hurt ,  but after a nice stretch and a hot shower I loosen up . sometimes I might feel a sharpe pain in sternum and sometimes my chest will get a slightly tight not as tight as I know it can get and that’s all I experience for the past two weeks . Also my bones crack and pop a lot","Try to mange you flare ups ! The less often you have flare ups the less often you have to feel like that . The worst part for me is when my chest gets tight I hate it , I try to walk around when I get like that don’t think about “ oh my gosh my chest is tight because it’ll make it worse the best way to deal is distract yourself !  Walk about or listen to music go on a drive anything to get it out ur head and usually the chest tightness will go down after a few hours ! It’s not your heart I promise !! It’s the costo getting a little upset that’s all don’t be afraid of it !!","So I think I’m getting it now !! I’m feeling a lot better or maybe I’m not maybe I’ve just been better because my costo hasn’t flared up in a few days . But what I’ve learned is that ... if you become friends with costo like really find out what it likes and doesn’t like it’ll become more manageable . With that being said don’t let it stop you from having a life! don’t let it stop you from creating a new one either , find your new normal it’s hard and it’s sucks not being as active .. But it’s okay working on posture , stretching , taking nice little walks in the park . Or when ur not having such good days drink sum ginger tea read a book meditate or talk to someone who cares about you . The more you connect with ur costo the more good days you’ll have . Feeling hopeful thought I’d share !!!","I know it’s different for every person and different cause can make them happen more often . But what are sum of the does and don’t ? What do you guys do on a daily biases , how do you have a quality of life without causing too much flair up ? And how many times on average do you get a flair,  up and how long does a flair up last usually .",Nahhh The worse part for me is the chest tightness I can handle the pain the chest tightness is what gets me everytime !!!,Lol your making me hungry!! My diet is so bland but I think my gerd is getting a lil better so hopefully I can eat more soon . And I think costo is so hard to get rid of is because it’s chronic inflammation and that’s the harsh reality and inflammation is damn near impossible to get ride of if isn’t not acute .,"Yeah I eat a lot bro rice avocado but I miss spicy foods lol !! I never hade stomach problems before until I took too many naproxen . What do you do to treat your costo ??? And for when you go back to school the best thing would be to eat a lot of vegetables because they don’t have to be cooked , u can cut them up into small pieces and you should get a mini fridge!!",So like a lot of rice ? And it does have a nasty taste but it’s so goood really is worth it !!,I also drink aloe juice it’s really good u should try that if you haven’t already,I’m taking the Pantoprazole for a month my doctor gave me !,Thank thank this is good advice I can follow !!! So what do u usually eat ??,Same here omg ! Naproxen has messed my stomach up but that’s the only treatment doctors give I have gerd now as well because of it smh ! Now when I’m in super pain I cant take anything . Hey I have a question did you stomach ever get better ?? And me either man I don’t think it’s ever going away tbh can’t do anything I love to do anymore just stay in the house and don’t move to much it’s no kinda life to live . It won’t just go away it won’t it’s stuck in there or sum shit,I think that the point of Rolfing is the same as a chiro because there tryna get everything back to how it’s intended to be . But since there so rough and are costo is soooo sensitive it cause flare ups for people . I just wish Rolfing wasn’t so expensive,I’m pretty sure most people are unbalanced but costo is not well known at all so that’s the sucky part we can’t bring enough awareness to this issue . I’m gonna look into Rolfing though and see what it’s all about !! How many times have you went so far ?,So why does everybody say it’s inflammation the the sternum if it’s more than that witch I always thought it was more ! So how do you get mobility if you can’t work out one and two how come people who are totally fit get it as well,"I’ve had costo for a month and I have a question, why is it mostly the left arm that gets all tight ? When usually people dominate hand is the right . And then does anyone notice that the left arm will be tight when  the chest isn’t tight even .","If I have sex with my girl too hard I get a flare up ? If I go to an amusement park if I smoke or drink , can’t even exercise just yoga can’t swim . Fuck figuring out what causes a flare up need figure out  why this shit has effected you for 10 whole years I’ve only hade mines 1 month and I definitely kill myself before it ever gets that far","But it doesn’t make sense ten years like wth how can somthing have inflammation for ten years . Why won’t it go away this is more than inflammation, this is a dease of sun sort . When your not having a flare up why won’t it get lower to the point where it goes away . And everything cases a flare up of u do tooo much of anything will cause one and type of activity any kinda fun man fuck that that’s not the life I wanna live u can’t do shit",And what do they do exactly to your body ?,Well you gotta convince people who have money lol cuz I’m not that person,People don’t have money to pay 170 a session that’s craziness but if it cure you . Post about everywhere even make a YouTube anything to get it out there . And maybe it’ll become the new cure for costo and they’ll lower the price u never know !,Chiropractor*,"No i don’t have insurance, I’m already paying for corporate , costo is not all I have I also have gerd and tension headaches . I’ll give it a try next but honestly I just don’t give a shit anymore I’ll eventually probably just kill myself or sum shit but until then pain pain more pain it is !","That’s good to hear that you having relief ... keep going once you cured completely let me know . Because I’m not hopeful I don’t think it will go away yes it will get very calm but it will come back for me .. it’s very rare once it’s stuck in your body it’s stuck . It’s so sad there is no cure for so many things makes me feel like that the point doctor don’t want anyone to heal cuz they make more money with us not . it should not take me going place to place spending money every where to
find relief . It is what it is I guess I’ll just be grateful it’s not cancer ."

j-sp,"Hey, so the past few months I feel like my mental health just keeps declining. I'm so exhausted all the time, i really feel like I can't do anything. I've started having panic attacks again (I presume that's what they are) which I haven't had in a couple of months and my anxiety is at an all time high and I can't really explain why. My heart just feels like it's pounding in my throat half the time.

So my question is, how do I speak to a GP about this? The thought of even going to the doctor's really makes me anxious and I end up talking myself out of it before I even phone for an appointment. I have been before a couple of years ago and they put me on sertraline but I just gave up and ended up not going back. How do you explain to your gp what's going on?","Hey, I'm having a pretty hard time dealing with my anxiety and stuff just now as well, so honestly I'm not sure what helps. What I have been doing is watching a lot of tv/my favourite youtube channel and it takes me away from what my head is dancing around and forget about it, even if it's just for a while. 

Have to add that it's pretty damn temporary and as soon as the tv is off its back, but a temporary break from it is better than none at all imo.","I didn't even know that could happen! Yeah the second wave just kinda really caught me off guard cause I was speaking to someone at the time and just had to clear out lol, leaves me kind of embarrassed once it's over tbh. Thanks for this comment hopefully I'll be slightly more prepared if it happens again now!","Hey, so today is the first time in a while I've had a panic attack, although it lasted a lot longer than they usually do. Whatever I was experiencing lasted about an hour and a half and I was wondering if anxiety attacks typically last longer? Or if panic attacks can be longer?

Honestly it has completely drained me today and it just felt like it wasn't going to stop. It hit me very suddenly too, then kind of slowed down a bit once someone was talking to me then got worse again very suddenly? Just wondering if anyone else has experienced an attack like that, or maybe it was two in quick succession?

Just really caught me off guard today and I guess I feel a bit lost after it all.","I've been so desperate to find villanelle outfits for animal crossing and you've blessed me with them, these are amazing!! Also my two obsessions right now as well...",Oh thank you! I never knew that it existed so worth a shot! Im actually gonna need to get some more nasal spray too so thanks for the reminder haha,"Thanks! I've kinda looked into that before because there's been some fruits that just make my mouth super itchy, it's mad!","Oh same, itchy ears are the worst!! I'll try gargling the salt water, thanks! Need something I can at my work as well because gargling warn salt water isn't an option there

I've never had the injection, I tend to switch tablets every year or so because I don't think they work that great if you use the same ones all the time (I don't think they do much anyway) but I've only tried the three kinds","Anyone else feel the need to rip the roof of their mouth out during hayfever seasons? I can't think of much to get it away, if it's really itchy I'll take a sip of fizzy juice and it temporarily calms it down, but not for long - it drives me insane!! Does anyone have any tips?","Mine has only really done it for 20 mins at most, so I'm thankful that it hasn't been longer! But I can't think of a single thing to make it go away","Yes!! Been searching for this post, I've only noticed it happening the past couple of years too, and not to the extent you seem to be getting it at (yet) but I feel dizzy when it happens and it throws me off balance a bit? It's awful! And I've no idea how to get rid of it so just need to wait til it passes, but it's a horrible sensation and proof that my hayfever just likes to spice things up even more every year 😴","Hey, I had a dream today that was really weird, never really felt like this before. So I'm my dream I was hallucinating. I was in my flat and there was a wall where there isn't one, and it was old and the paint was flaking off it, but the other people in my dream couldn't see it, despite me being able to hit it.

I was also hallucinating different decor in the room next to this wall, but the wall was always the thing j kept coming back to. The fact that no one else could see it made me panic in my dream, like a severe panic attack. 

I also went to work in my dream and fell out with a colleague (this colleague was one of the people that I brought round to my house to show the wall, we fell out for a completely different reason)

The dream was really unsettling tbh, and was wondering if anyone had any ideas? Hallucinating in a dream was very strange",Nice one!! 💪,"Mine kind of just starts with feeling really anxious, like everything is caving in around me? It's a really weird feeling but everything it totally overwhelming and it sets me off, sometimes I can calm myself down but at work the other day it just took forever, one of the worst ones I've had. Just felt like I couldn't breathe, couldn't walk/talk, went outside to sit myself away from all the noise and that's when it got really bad and my hands started cramping. Ended up having to go into the office and getting my manager to help. Never really thought about checking on here for help before but it's been really reassuring, totally appreciate everyone's responses, so thank you!","I never knew how bad the cramps could get, my face and legs usually get pins and needles but the cramp in my hands is unreal, it's really out my mind at ease a bit knowing that it happens to other people!","I loved this quote because it was so so Todd but also just, really profound in its own way. Genuinely thought about it all the time since watching the finale.",Done - looking forward to it!,This is amazing and tbh I'd probably buy a print of it!,I've just moved into a flat last year and slowly trying to get my finances in order a bit - having a mortgage and bills is taking up a lot of it - but I was considering trying to save up so I could pay to see someone.,"Thank you so much! You've no idea how much better that's helped me feel after the last couple of days I've had, I had a pretty big panic attack at work in front of one of my managers and I just felt absolutely useless, at the one place I usually feel useful. I was really embarrassed about going into work the next day and I hate letting people see me get like that, especially my bosses.","Thanks for responding! I like to hear the biology side of it because it really helps me rationalise what's happening, might even save this on my phone so if/when it happens I can read through it, especially if I'm having a panic attack when I'm myself.","Yeah I really struggle getting to the doctors, i can't even really say why it's just a nerves thing I suppose. I just get all worked up about going and keep telling myself that nothing they do will help, even though I know it's unreasonable/irrational to think that!","Yeah that's a good point, the more that happens I'll know what's going on, thanks! Just the first time it happened it just made me panic more and o just couldn't believe how painful it felt trying to move them, my hands still feel stiff a couple of days later! 

You only ever really hear about a few symptoms of panic attacks that when you have some you've never heard of before, it worries you, so I'm glad I posted on here 😅","Thank you! Yeah my face and legs go pretty numb real quick, my hands have only done that a few times though so I was just worried a bit, my hands just feel awful afterwards","This might be one of the best drawings I've seen of arthuuuur, nice one!","Hey, new to this subreddit, but was looking for some I dunno, affirmation? Feel a little less alone? I've had panic attacks occasionally over the past few years, but recently they've been a lot tougher than I've ever had them. I've been getting cramp in my hands to the point they're curled up like claws during the attacks, and it's just so painful and I find it really hard to come out of it. Wondering if anyone else gets the same? If anyone experiences it how do you get yourself calm enough to get your fingers out of that position? 

The panic attacks were hard enough to deal with but anytime my hands do that it just makes me panic more","I mean not that I'm really aware of I suppose, possibly fighting a change!","Thanks! I read that earlier, quite interesting although I thought maybe the way I was holding the snake was maybe significant because all the suggestion on that are mostly about finding snakes outside/inside your house etc

Just found it really odd because I don't have any connections to snakes/don't live in a place that you come across them!","Hi, new to this subreddit, but really enjoy looking up dream analysis when I've had a really vivid dream, sometimes you don't always get exactly what you're looking for though, so here goes...

This was a small dream, but vivid nonetheless. I was sitting out the passenger side of a car, holding a cobra (yellow/brown in colour) with my thumb on the back of its head and my other hand holding further down it's body. The cobra was relatively small, but I was struggling to hold it and it kept spitting it's venom out. The more it's struggled, the more I pushed my thumb into the back of its head, til I felt like I was effectively squeezing the venom out?

I remember thinking in the dream I was taking the cobra somewhere, but I never managed to get in the car and leave. I remember feeling quite frustrated and then felt quite worried as the snake was getting closer and closer to biting my hand, but I don't think it actually did (or I woke up before it did)

I don't usually have dreams about snakes, in fact I think this is only the second dream with a snake in it that I can remember. Any ideas?"

Unanswered phone calls. Unanswered text messages. People trying to reach me. They know I’m not well. I tried to seek help but nothing worked for me. Nothing helped. Nothing made me feel better. Happier. I suffer still. As the sun sets today, so does mine. 
A knock on the door. “I know you’re in there! Open up!” How does she know I’m here? She knocks again. “Why haven’t you answered my calls or messages? I can hear you walking! Let me in! Please!” 
I can’t let her in. I can’t let her see me like this. Hell, I can barely stand to see myself like this. I hear her footsteps get quieter as she leaves my door. She realizes what I am about to do. She must be going to get the super to unlock the door. Or maybe seek help from the police. 
A loaded snub-nosed revolver sits on a coffee table nearby. The apartment is dark and solemn. Death waits for me. Now or never. I pick up the revolver of the small table and kneel with my back up against a wall adjacent to my door. I can hear her coming back and I can hear someone walking with her. A voice I don’t recognize. She is hammering on my door. “You will be fine. You’ll be okay. It will all be okay in the end.” Her voice cracks. 
I close my eyes and put the barrel of the gun to my forehead. I hear keys jiggling at my door. Fear runs through me. I pull the trigger before I have time to think anymore. The gun makes a ‘click’ sound as the chamber rotates and the next round aligns with the hammer. The round must have been a dud. I’m alive. I shouldn’t be. I should be dead. Someone or something must be looking out for me.
She and the super enter accompanied by two police officers. I’m numb. The revolver falls from my hands. I release my legs from underneath of my body and crumble onto the floor. I’m alive. They try to speak to me. She asks why I tried to end my life. The officers ask if I am okay. My super also asks if I am okay. I think she and My super are in shock by what almost occurred today.
I don’t respond. I can’t respond. I am in a state of shock and disbelief that almost took my life. I’ve heard it said that when someone ends their own life, it doesn’t end their suffering, it transfers it to others. I finally managed to speak.
“I’ll be okay.” I tell everyone hovering over me as a try to recompose myself. I turn to her. “Will you stay with me tonight? I don’t feel safe being alone right now.  She agrees to stay with me for the night if for nothing else than to watch over me and make sure I don’t do anything irrational. The officers stay long enough to make sure that I am okay and give me numbers to call if I am ever alone and need help. They leave. Now it’s just me and her. Alone together.
After a brief moment’s silence. 
“You were going to kill yourself. You were going to put me – put your family and your friends- through that. Through grieving for your death. How could you even think of doing something like that? How could you do that to everyone who loves you and cares about you? What’s wrong? Why are you so upset? What’s going on?”
I look to her to respond, but I have no words. I can’t find the answers to her questions. I sit on the floor and think in silence. She speaks again. “It will all be okay in the end.”
Reality hits me. She is still outside my door.  I am crying. A dark smile appears on my face. Yes. Everything will be fine in the end. The revolver clicks and with a bang a lifeless corpse slumps over on the ground as scarlet blood begins to seep from the wound and pool on the wood floor. A life has ended. A scream from outside minutes emergency services arrive at the apartment to remove the corpse now laying in a pool of blood, a revolver now with one less bullet slowly being covered in the still growing pool of scarlet fluid.
The End.




A Message from me:
I’ve been coping with depression for a while stemming from various things that I’m not going to get into here. I decided to write this quick story to help me cope with the depression and anxiety I’ve been feeling for the last few months and maybe to gain e little perspective. I’ve been dealing with suicide ideation and feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness myself and plan on seeking help. Suicide is not a solution when it comes to coping with any mental illness, not just depression or anxiety. If you are having thoughts of suicide or think you may try to end your own life, please reach out to someone or call a suicide prevention hotline.

[directed at my ex]

By the time you’re reading this I’ll be gone. I’ll be dead. I’m not sure how you’ll be feeling. I’d like to sit here and write that I know you’ll find the times ahead difficult but that I’ll always be watching over you, but I don’t think that’s the case. If I’m being honest, I think you’ll cry to [REDACTED] for a bit and then move on with your life. You’ll tell yourself that it’s what I’d have wanted. Well I’m here to tell you it’s not. What I want is for you to feel this pain that I’ve been feeling for so long. I want you to hurt so badly that you can’t stand, the crushing weight of the mental agony causes you to collapse to the floor in complete defeat. I want basic tasks to become chores, for you to wake up in the morning and wish that your life was over. I want you to feel a pull towards passing vehicles on the way to school with the knowledge that with one step they could crush the life out of you, I want you to have to physically stop yourself from closing your eyes and embracing the peacefulness that death brings. I want you to desire death, to crave it. I want you to pull away from all of your family and friends, to become a shell of the person you once were. But for nobody to notice. Nobody to care. You probably think I’m a monster for wishing these things onto you. Maybe I am. But that’s okay, because I’m gone forever and you will never have to deal with me ever again. That’ll make you happy I bet. I could feel you distancing yourself, replying to me was becoming a bother, I was just that depressed ex who never seemed to leave you alone. I hate that I became that. I hate that you made me become that. Even at one of my lowest points, when I cautiously allowed you in, you didn’t seem to care. It was like I’d told a brick wall. you were inpatient with me when all I needed was somebody by my side. I feel like a fool for imagining that you’d be that somebody, that you’d  ask after me, check up on me, make sure I was doing better. Nothing. Delivered- 2h. Delivered- 5h. Delivered- 18h. Delivered- 21h. Do you know how much that hurt me [REDACTED]? You were my entire world. My entire world, for so long. And then you were gone. And now you’re his entire world. His best friend. His girlfriend. The girl he feels he can be himself around. He gets to laugh and chat with your family, talk about the future, laugh over silly things. And do you know where I am? Alone. Pushed out of the loop. I knew I wouldn’t ever have that with you again and it killed me. Literally it killed me. Do you know how soul destroying it is to see the person that you once trusted with your darkest secrets laughing and smiling with someone else while you watch from a distance? Well no, you don’t do you, because I couldn’t do that to you. I couldn’t send you pictures of me and your replacement and sleep peacefully at night. But you can. You did. You’re the reason I’m dead. You ruined me. You broke me. And now I’m gone.
Squid",Damn I mean- not wrong,I’ve never in my life seen an English person use that as swearing and I’ve lived in England my whole life,"Okay thanks, I’ll bear that I’m mind next time",Well that’s bad news,I love my brother machine! What is undesirable about them? Genuine question,I adore the british sewing bee :),Use a rotary cutter instead of scissors :),Overlocker! Not a necessity but nice for a neat finish,On a sewing machine you could still lettuce hem but it won’t be quite the same unfortunately,"Could get a similar look by lettuce hemming with an overlocker, idk how you’d make the lacy bit thicker though",You could make a feature of it and add in some panels with complimentary fabric?,"I have the computerised brother FS40, granted it is £230 but it’s pretty great. Has a bunch of cool stitches and runs really smoothly.

Probably not, so why go to his?",Your situation is scarily similar... are you 100% sure it wasn’t him,Sounds like she was trying to make a joke out of it for fear of rejection and then you kinda threw that onto her... i can see myself being both sides of this though,This is accurate,"I wondered this, maybe if they’ve been getting along during quarantine she’s just interested in a catch up...",They would kill for an unhappy man? I don’t think so,"Yes. My parents moved from South Africa to England 2 years before I was born and ended up staying. They left all their family behind and even now, many years later we all feel as though we don't quite fit in. Any visits to SA costs the family £10,000. This means we go once a year at best. It's tricky hearing friends talk about heading down to the coast to visit their grandparents and such, but we have a great life here which I am endlessly grateful for. We will all always long to go home, but accepting that England is your home and emersing yourself into the lifestyle helps one settle down","sounds like a Philip Schofield kinda situation to me. All ill say is that if you're gonna separate, do it before the children are too old and will find it difficult to adjust. See how things play out, but there's a high chance she just wants to experiment and will regret any drastic changes to your relationship","Hey, it's gonna be okay. It sounds like you really need to get out of this relationship, it's dragging you down. Is there any way you could start some kind of work/ education program until you are able to get a job and support yourself? Then you may be able to rent somewhere for you and your daughter to stay. The most important thing to do right now is get support. Find local charities or organisations who can maybe get you some counselling. You deserve to live a happy and fulfilling life, so does your daughter. There is a future for you. If you can, you could return home and crash at friends until you get back on your feet. You might just need to familiarise yourself with people you've known for a long time. I know this advice isn't really worth much but you aren't alone and there is hope for you. You don't deserve to lead a miserable and abusive life. Stay strong, keep your head up and keep fighting.

I forgot to add, talk to your husband about options for separating if it is safe to do so. Maybe if you are both on the same page it will be easier to sort something out and you can have an amicable relationship in separate houses. 

In addition, if the car is legally yours, then it is yours!","Woah. That is one hell of a story. I (F) have been with girls and can assure you that she must have done some black magic to take a fist unlubed. Definitely some cheating going on there I'd say... Also seems strange that that never happened before, the change throughout the month is 100 percent not that drastic! Not to be insensitive but the whole situation is quite comical too haha!","Hmm. I would say that you are overthinking it a bit! In the grand scheme of things, a past relationship of 3,5 years isn't very long, and you guys could get married and spend the rest of your lives together which would give you endless time to learn more about each other. Also, not many relationships that start at 18 are serious, it's very plausible that they were just kids messing around. Who doesn't at that age! If he has downplayed his past, it's certainly to reassure you and not make you feel as though you should compare the relationships. You wouldn't want him going on and on about the details of their relationship, it would probably make you feel bad about yourself right! I think you need to take some time to focus on the present and remember that lockdown, as well as an LDR, is maybe making you a little paranoid haha. Lots of peoples relationships have been put under stress during quarantine, but I don't think digging up the past will help you. Definitely communicate your concerns to him, but also leave it in the past! They broke up for a reason, if she was perfect then he wouldn't be with you right now!",at least you admit it tbf
Quacking-Journalist,"I don't think I'm someone who is clinically depressed but somehow, thoughts of suicide and murder is very normal for me.

My family life is very stable in relation to most people in this thread from my observation. I am a priviledged middle class person with a complete family and hardly ever spanked in my life. The only downside is that my dad spits hurtful words here and it's only getting worse.

I know this isn't my place to complain, but I can't stand anymore years of this. I've been hearing this for my entire life now whether it be directed to my mother or at me.

Recently, it's been starting to get to me. Whenever (verbal) chaos erupts, I have this overwhelming urge to grab our kitchen knife, kill my little sister, and then kill myself. Why? So that my parents and especially my dad won't have anymore burdens, us children, to think about.

I also recently learned a couple details about my father and mother that happened before I was born/still a baby. Coupled with how often chaos starts, I have theorized that my father is only bound to us by responsibility and not love but I really don't want to accept it. 

Because accepting it means that my childhood was a lie and that my only purpose is to be a retirement support. So if I actually went ahead with the kitchen knife, my father's plans will be ruined and knowing my mother's martyrdom, she might go insane. Our deaths will only spread pain and.. I REALLY don't want that.

Gosh, I know I sound whiny haha but I hope atleast some of you understand what a lifetime of struggling against words feels like. I really just want peace.",Time to boycott her husband's business too then.,Finally! Actual treasure! XDD,"As a starter BS, the demand for adventurer garb is a godsend XD.

I've been earning spina by selling to npcs en masse.

Farm some nemicos and grape jellies in Ultimea Sewer Southeast then hop into your guild bar every once in a while to sell/process the items in the general store.

I earned +30k after an hour of farming.","For low level char, go to Reug Salt Plains and kill the Piedras. That's how I started out as a BS haha","Same experience over here. Non-stop begging from the same people.
But when did this all start? For me, it seems like the halloween event triggered this.","I've noticed that eversince I started publicly selling, beggars would just randomly come up to me claiming that they are new and need money.
I tell em places to farm and what to look for but it immediately falls silent.

One day, I found a bunch of finalers posing as ""newbies"" asking for help. The person was using magic finale on frickin Lavarcas!!! I know it sounds unrelated but I think there's a connection between this and the sudden influx of ""newbie"" beggars.

What's even more annoying is when they overthrow the shout chat! I hate how they're just shouting for money instead of actually playing the darn game.","I was in the same situation as you too!
I got in Toram because of school friends introducing me to it. Yes, I had an easier start because I was part of a guild immediately but.. it was a pretty dead one most of the time.

I spent most of my days alone or partying with other people for pure business (or rather, farming) matters. For my first three months, I was alone and pretty weak. I heavily relied on mercs to get through the main quest.

It changed during the Halloween event though, when I decided to take advantage of the need and started selling sweets. Suddenly, many people were talking to me and that is when I met some good friends (including kind donors and even beggars) and made a new guild together. We have a discord and we've been playing together since then.

Perhaps, all you need is to.. somehow make your name known? Selling is a very good way to put yourself out there! Preferably sell something with a short name XD","How in the world are xtals even obtained?
Is it via the break parts and tapping thing?",That's the sad part. I'm keeping it here so hopefully less people will fall for it :((,"Sorry I cant type on the description bar.

I am wondering if anyone else here in the Philippines received this? It's clearly a scam since I've never entered any lottery/raffle/etc.","This needs more attention.
Where exactly did you find the code, OP?","The page deleted this post HAHAHA but we've got receipts. 
Oh crap idk how to post pics here",This is an awesome story! Please continue this,"Geezus fuck m8.
You had me!","Could you perhaps post a picture of those clippings? You can always censor out the name of the town you're in. When was the first report you saw and when was the last that someone had gone missing?

The other comments are right. You need a buddy system.. after confirming they are trustworthy, of course.

Or since you suffer from dyslexia, you might suffer other conditions as well like anxiety.","Thank you so much for your reply!

Yes, business courses are definitely much harder.. considering that I didn't do well in accounting and am not much interested in it, I probably won't do very well in a business course either.

Now Communications could be a literal alternative but I think I'll end up doing the same things, under the same stress, and same pay. Oh well, I guess that's just life.

I debated in mind with the thought of taking an Entrepreneurship course but it's silly because I could always build a business without any college education.

I'm going to a private university, it's the opposite in my country. Private universities are easier to apply to and give more leeway than state universities.

Thank you so much again for your suggestion!","An editor totally changed your angle or the paper was mistook as full pro-admin? How'd that happen??

Thank you very much btw. However, have you ever considered other courses other than something media-related that's close enough?",I'm very sure that journalists aren't always allowed to tell the truth.,"Your friend is super passionate! Where does she work in? 

I've also heard of the different types of news outlets. Do you get paid for it or is it just your willing contribution?

I do agree with the part about mainstream media.. abysmal working conditions but it's where all the entry levels have to go. I hope that my school has some hybrid programs as well (Ateneo de Naga)

Also, do you possibly know why it's so competitive here in the media sector?","I always hear that.. that the only thing making anything media related worthy enough for people to still be there are the people you meet and befriend.

zutari,"I always feel fatigued.. I understand this is a common symptom of depression, but I'm wondering if they make any kind of medicine for this. I hate coffee, yet I have been trying to drink as much as possible just so I feel like doing something (anything). 

&#x200B;

As soon as I stand up I feel like sitting down. I was sitting in my gaming chair and had to go lie down in bed because sitting up was exhausting me. I have gotten blood tests and urine tests to rule out physical symptoms. Is anyone on medication specifically that helps their fatigue?","When I stand up sometimes without sitting up for a minute first gets me lightheaded. I get dizzy and my eyes go black. Sometimes It's not immediate, but a minute or so after I start moving. It also sometimes happens when I pee (Male). I've fallen and hit my head or something. I don't usually lose conciousness, but just feel weak, dizzy, and fall. 

&#x200B;

When I lie in bed, my limbs often go numb very quickly like there is no circulation going through. The other day I was shopping as normal and when I started to pay, my body started getting really hot, started spinning, and I collapsed. 

&#x200B;

I went to a doctor and my blood pressure is perfect. They measured it right after standing up, laying down, sitting down, all fine. I don't get light headed every time, but I have certain times when I do, but I can't seem to find anything connecting the times it occurs. They took my blood and a urine sample and said that it all looks okay so they don't know what to do.  I was afraid of a heart issue, but he said that eyes going black is usually not indicive of heart issues. 

&#x200B;

I'm not sure if this is connected, but Due to my mental health issues (written below) I have trouble sleeping and I find it really hard to do simple things. When I stand up, I immediately feel fatigued and I want to sit down. Walking for 10 minutes exhausts me. I'm not sure if this is a symptom or perhaps connected to my depression. 

I have Borderline personality disorder and Depression, and the doctor told me he thinks it's a mental problem. (As an asside, I startred being medicated for those conditions a year ago and my symptoms go back about five years, so it can't be any medicine I am on.)  Does anyone have an idea what this can be?","When I stand up sometimes without sitting up for a minute first gets me lightheaded. I get dizzy and my eyes go black.

I went to a doctor and my blood pressure is perfect. They measured it right after standing up, laying down, sitting down, all fine. I don't get light headed every time, but I have certain times when I do, but I can't seem to find anything connecting the times it occurs. They took my blood and a urine sample and said that it all looks okay so they don't know what to do.  I was afraid of a heart issue, but he said that eyes going black is usually not indicive of heart issues.

I'm not sure if this is connected, but Due to my mental health issues (written below) I have trouble sleeping and I find it really hard to do simple things. When I stand up, I immediately feel fatigued and I want to sit down. Walking for 10 minutes exhausts me. I'm not sure if this is a symptom or perhaps connected to my depression. 

I have Borderline personality disorder and Depression, and the doctor told me he thinks it's a mental problem. (As an asside, I startred being medicated for those conditions a year ago and my symptoms go back about five years, so it can't be any medicine I am on.)  Does anyone have an idea what this can be?"," [https://www.deviantart.com/zutari/art/Tracer-in-Hanamura-819983581?ga\_submit\_new=10%3A1573507990&ga\_type=edit&ga\_changes=1](https://www.deviantart.com/zutari/art/Tracer-in-Hanamura-819983581?ga_submit_new=10%3A1573507990&ga_type=edit&ga_changes=1)

I’m one of those people that always try to work things out. I’m always the one fighting to keep a connection. I’m kind of done fighting. All I have now is really myself.

My ex is a last resort.,I’m going to be using Voice memo for this because I really don’t have any energy to do anything right now. I am a 20-year-old female and just got kicked out of my house. I had just went to Washington DC to go confess my love to my ex-boyfriend I have loved since I met him three years ago. I really don’t know who to go to right now. I went with my little sister and her boyfriend to DC they thought that we could all make a fun trip out of it and I enjoyed their company. We didn’t tell anyone where we were going we left Thursday night and just came back last night. There has been a lot of family problems going on at home. My little sister is battling depression and I have been trying to help her she just turned 18 Saturday and she just moved in with her boyfriend sister tonight. I helped her get over there and in return I have also been kicked out. I’m not really sure who I should go to and I’m not really sure where I want to go. I do feel as though my parents want me to live here but me personally I don’t want to. I’ve lived here my whole entire life everything I own is here. I don’t have a job or any Life here. All that is here in this small town is family. Which right now in life I don’t believe is the best thing for me. My whole life I’ve been sheltered by my family and I’ve never really went out and done anything for myself and I’m 20 years old. Me and my ex really are not on the best terms right now. But I feel as though I should message him and tell him what has happened and ask if I can drive up to where he’s going to college and stay at his place until I can get back on my feet. Even though me and him are not on the best terms right now and he is angry with me I feel like it wouldn’t hurt to try because honestly he’s really only person I feel comfortable going towards right now. Not really sure what to do any advice would help. And if you want more backstory on me and my exes relationship I have a few posts but you can look at on my page.,Me and my ex reconnected. After 2 years of being apart. He lives 12 hours away in Boston going to college. I recently visited him and fell Inlove all over again. I have deep feelings for him. He was wanting to see me while he was back home for thanksgiving which is 6 hours away from me. We were long distance. Met online. I have deep feelings for him and want to tell him but I’m scared of losing him. My sister and her boyfriend which I consider like a brother. Think I should make a grand romantic gesture and go see him in person and tell him everything. They obviously would go with me for support. And if all goes wrong we have a mini road trip. I’m really considering this. I really do believe me and this guy have something worth fighting for. But like I said I’m so scared to lose him.,Thank you so much for this.,I want to so bad but I’m so afraid of losing him. Right now he’s not in a good headspace.

We live 12 hours away from each other. Used to be 6 but he moved away to college. He will text me asking me if I want to randomly come see him. Like for example this morning he asked if I wanted to drive to his hometown which is 6 hours away and see each other and drive back later that night. He offered gas as well. I was willing to do it but then he changed his mind. He said he didn’t want to sound desperate. I was worried for him because he’s not In a great headspace right now and I kind of overstepped and he blocked me. It kind of hurt. I would do anything for this guy. He had mentioned me flying out to where he goes to college before or after Christmas and to stay at his place for a week. Which I’m totally down for. He even mentioned coming to me. Idk I’m so confused I love him so much and he doesn’t really know that. We have some sort of relationship. I’m not really sure what to do or say anymore. I want to work towards something in the near future but I’m not sure where he stands. And I don’t know how to ask that without seeming desperate or overstepping.,"Origin: Bristol TN

But just maybe not right now at this time.,I stayed with my other ex for 2 years because I kept believing he would change. But soon realized we just weren’t meant to be.,An ex,You’re an amazing person. This is exactly what I needed to hear right now. Thank you so much for taking the time to write this. It’s greatly appreciated. I feel %100 better now.,Honestly I didn’t really plan a day to go back home like 1-2 weeks max. I just spent a lot of money to come here and I’ve only been here 3 days and it’s been awful. I really didnt think it would be this bad.,"I F(20) flew out to see my M (19) ex boyfriend. We ended things 2 years ago and we were long distance. While we were dating I would always go visit him and spend a lot of money doing so. He still lived with his parents and they didn’t know I existed for awhile and they disliked me so we had to hide our relationship. He was my first love and my first real heartbreak. I was also his. Fast forward 2 years later. He went off to college in Boston and I stayed home and just got a job and had a boyfriend I met in my hometown. I dated this guy for about 2 years. My ex was always more ambitious than me and driven. I just live life day by day and take care of my family. I recently got broken up with by the guy I dated after him. It hurt because I saw him all the time. But in reality our relationship wasn’t healthy at all. Me and my ex get in contact and he offers me to come and stay at his place in Boston for a bit to get a break from my day to day life. And I was hesitant at first. But now I’m here. And we both agreed to no expectations. But we obviously both are connected in a weird way. He wanted me here to help get his life together like get off drugs and go to school and clean his place. Which I didn’t mind but now I feel as though we don’t connect at all. I mean we have causal sex which is great while it last. I just assumed we were friends with benefits and after this trip we would just go back to our day to day life and just check up on each other every once in awhile. He tells me I’m irritating and I talk too much. I’m trying to understand him but he is literally all over the place. It’s very overwhelming. I just feel like we don’t vibe at all. One minute he’s yelling at me and accusing me of stuff I would never do and the next he’s kissing me and telling me to be safe outside around the city. I would leave but I spent so much money to enjoy this trip. And now I just feel lost with barely any cash. I thought it would be like one of those amazing spur of the moment type things but now I’m thinking it’s a mistake. Any advice would help. I’m just lost :(


Update: I am now going home later today. Last night was a breaking point I thought he was going to hit me. I didn’t know who he was so I left his room. His roommate felt like something was going on and i told him everything. He made me lie to his roommates about where I’m from and where we met. But I caved and told him everything. We were both kind of scared of what could happen so we walked to his girlfriends place and I met the sweetest human bean ever.  This whole trip I’ve felt like I’ve been doing wrong. But it’s not me. And as much as I would love to help him I can’t.  About my update. I do need some advice. While I was here my ex told me stuff as in like he has stolen things like a key and other items from people he’s previously lived with and his now current roommates. He said he has been robbed before so I didn’t understand this because he should know how it feels to have your belongings messed with. I practically told his roommates everything I wasn’t supposed to tell them. Like he isn’t going to pay them back their finances and he has lied to them about things multiple times to their faces. I’m not sure if it was my place to tell all these things but in that moment I confided in these people because they made me feel normal. When I leave I’m sure their will be something done because of these issues and he’s going to obviously know I told them and probably hate me. I’m not sure if I crossed a line or not. Any advice would help.",I’m 20 and I once dated this now friend.  Thank you for the advice. I probably should of been more specific in my post.,I ruined my 4 days,I’ve already called. And right now I was on my way to go see him. I feel so lost,I don’t see any happiness for my future I just see sadness love makes me happy and all that does to me is rip my chest out,Yeah it’s so easy to just move on and be happy to be honest I’m tired of hearing that. I could really care less about my happiness anymore.,I’m obviously worth nothing if someone I thought that loved and cared about me could just drop me like I mean nothing and move on so quick. A whole 2 years of my life practically meant nothing. My happiness was him.,I hope it can help. I just feel so empty like I’ve lost a part of myself. It just doesn’t feel real. Time goes by so slow. And every second it hurts. I wish a part of me would just think fuck him and hope he never comes back but all I can think is he will. Thinking that makes me feel better it’s so wrong.

Major_Ziggy,"I've been working on a Master's degree in engineering while working full time in the semiconductor industry.  This semester they're wanting me to work 12 hour night shifts while I'm doing daytime classes and research.  I've always had a hard time with my depression while working night shift and my circadian rhythm never really seems to adapt, but when that's all that's on my plate I can deal, but I've been doing it with school for a week now and I can already tell that I can't handle it.  I hear success stories all the time where people are doing shift work and going to school, especially at the company I work at, and I don't know what makes them able to handle it and not me.  My wife and parents have both expressed concern that I've got too much on my plate and I know they're right, but the thought of talking to my boss about quitting is daunting to say the least, especially since he's one of those success stories I mentioned.

I'm hoping someone can give me some ideas on how I can balance my schedule better and maybe give myself a little R&R time in between the craziness. I'm extra desperate right now because I'm supposed to switch to night shift (6:30 PM - 6:30 AM) next semester and I honestly think it might kill me if I don't change something.

So dealing with I thought was headaches weeks on end and going to a doctor found it was actually seborrheic dermatitis. So that took months but it finally cleared up. When I thought it was over More symptoms followed after this loss of appetite and feel very gassy, back and joint pain along with shoulder blade pain  frequently my back cracks now almost 24/7 with pain following it after. Dizziness, itchy anus, sweaty and sometimes itchy fall over the body,  Loss of sex drive and don’t get hard as I used too since I’m a male 20 years old. Rashes that appear around my body and then go away. Although a rash developed on both my hands and hasn’t gone away but is slowly losing its bright red color. Cold hands and feet with tingling and burning sometimes I also see discoloration as sometimes my feet are white but toes are red same with my hands. When I get out of the shower my hands and feet are bright red. There is also a purple like bruise on my foot looks like a blood clot. Heart palpitations even when I lay down I feel it hard and fast it gets worse sometimes when I eat or I get nervous, And my overall body temperature I feel cold not warm like I used too. I have a reduce in physical sensation and pain. I remember as a kid for example  I used to wash my hands and if it was really hot water I would retract my hand back fast well I tried this same thing with my new condition and I can leave my hand under the water now without really thinking of taking it out like physical pain has reduced a lot.  I also have twitchs and muscle spasms mainly in my back. My newest symptom is chest pain that won’t go away like someone is sitting on my chest. As for mental symptoms anxiety, depression, and OCD. During these two years I’ve went to doctors to get blood work done and everything came back fine same with a cat scan and mri on my brain.

I can still laugh and cut up with my friends, get up in the morning and go to work, and do art (whenever I have the inspiration to do so). Lately, I’ve been feeling straight up miserable. I hate myself and everything about my situation. I’m never going to get a good job that I enjoy, I’m probably going to be stuck with money problems, and I’ll probably end up being alone for the rest of my life. If I do find someone, they aren’t going to care about me. I’ve already spent a year of my life with some guy who only kept me around because he was lonely. Then, spent another year letting him toy with me off and on because he didn’t know what he wanted. I keep looking for all sorts of stupid signs that things are going to get better. I don’t think they ever will. I’m a failed artist who will never be able to get a good enough education to do anything. I’m already a senior in high school. It’s too late. I’m so worried about everyone at work hating me and I constantly apologize and ask if they’re mad at me for reassurance. I’m not suicidal, though. Even tho I sometimes fantasize about it, I don’t actually want to do it. Most of the time I just think about non-lethal forms of self-harm such as letting someone beat the crap out of me or starving myself until I’m borderline dead. (it sounds stupid, I know). I already had my mom walk out on me. I’ve had to cut so many other people out of my life as well. My aunt and uncle, my sister (who is currently pregnant), my ex (who tricked me into feeling loved), and now it’s probably going to be my friends once I graduate. They’re the only people I really have to look forward to. I hold too much bitterness towards everyone else in my life. I’m 18 and I already feel completely valueless. I just don’t know what to do or where to turn.","My guess is it doesn’t have anything to do with self-worth. It’s something that makes her feel confident and nice.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated.","I would like to build my own from scratch; but I think for now it would be best for me to just try and buff up the one I already have. It’s a fairly cheap HP 15 Notebook PC (will link specs if needed) that we had bought at Walmart (lmfao) and it’s nearly three years old, if not older. It has a lot of problems; the most notable being lagging and the occasional crash (only when I’m doing something important, though). I would like to fix those issues and also have it be able to run games like Red Dead Online and Skyrim. My only question is... how realistic is it for me to do this on a fairly small budget? (If even possible at all). It doesn’t have to be anything immensely fancy. Just something that will let me play some decently hefty games while also not taking 18 hours for them to download on steam (assuming that is the fault of the laptop)

The farthest I’ve ever gotten into learning a new language was when I was studying German a few years back. It always seems to circle back to that; so I’m wondering if I should just stick to German. However, there are so many other languages that I would like to learn as well such as: Russian, Swedish, Korean, German, French, and Japanese (possibly; but I’m  a little scared of Kanji). To people who found themselves in the same situation, how did you finally find a language to learn without getting distracted by other languages and daily life?","Oh, okay. Thank you so much!

If anyone has any suggestions, feel free to post them below! Thank you so much!","Hey, I am a 17F working my second job ever. Currently,  I just work within the deli of a small local grocery store making pizzas and then I usually help out on Wednesdays and Sundays serving what is regularly served on those days. I am always thirty minutes early, always make sure to do my job, and (when I’m done) I always try to ask if the people I work with need any help. Especially the two co-workers that I am talking about because I, at one point, actually felt pretty bad for them. I still do, to an extent. 

For a bit of context, the grocery store that I work at has basically been taken over by nepotism. It’s a chain grocery store and almost all of the shift managers are related to the store owner in some way. Obviously, this led to a lot of problems. Some of the managers don’t do their jobs very well at all and the ones we have in the deli have a habit of pushing all of the work onto their employees so that they don’t have to do anything. 

The two co-workers (well call them Abby and Sam) usually get hit the hardest. That’s why I usually always offer them my help whenever they need it. Hell, I have Abby 70 dollars to help her move into her new apartment (not much, but It was all I had at the time) which I now regret seeing as they literally bitch about me behind my back all of the time. I know this, because I over heard them one day while I was on break. Basically talking about how I don’t do anything and how I should be the one doing Abby’s job and how she should be doing my job instead (because I guess they think it’s easier?) despite the fact that I literally never have a day off. I’m either at school or I’m at work. Plus, the only thing she does is fry chicken and then cut up vegetables so that she can play on her phone the rest of the day. Hell, she’s getting to leave early today so that she can go and eat fried fish somewhere. 

Which, don’t get me wrong, I know that people are going to talk about people at work. That’s just how it goes. But, it’s so weird coming from the same people who I always try to help out whenever I can or am available to do so. Even giving one person all of the money I had left over from one of my paychecks. People are hella shady. How do you guys not let it get to you? 

Apologies for any grammar mistakes. On the plus side, the manager does really like me from what it seems. But idk about that anymore either.","Like, I get that they want to engage with their audience and stuff as well as take part in what is usually associated with their music such as the Homestuck fandom, Danganranpa (sorry if I spelled that wrong), and other various things of the sort... it’s just kinda strange to me? Don’t get me wrong, I still love them and their music but this just seem sort of cheap to me, I guess. Maybe I’m looking too much into it.","Thank you for the suggestions, I really appreciate it. unfortunately braces wouldn’t fix it as I had a visit with my orthodontist a few years ago when i had turned sixteen and they said that the only thing I needed were braces to straighten my teeth up.

I don’t currently have any pictures straight on atm that aren’t just selfies. lol I’ll definitely post one tomorrow, though. My only problem with lip fillers is that my lips are already pretty full as it is and I’m worried that lip fillers would make that way too dramatic from the front view.

If you never would’ve posted that comment, then you never would’ve understood why they are seen as an icon for the non-binary community. That’s why I always wish that people would have a more open mind correcting others when it comes to topics like this.

It should always be innocent until proven guilty. If you have the police reports I think you should either post a link or image to them here or delete this post.","Yeah, I did break up with him tho.

Then, suddenly, when I was getting less attention I got nervous and broke it off because I didn’t want to have to deal with the pain of being broken up with.

But, now I feel like he’s getting pretty annoyed with me and whatnot. I also have a bit of anxiety, so I guess it could be that?

Don't get me wrong I'm a dumbass who does enjoy smoking, but I always warn people to never start. Some people can manage to control their smoking and keep it to a recreational minimum, however myself and many many other people in the world cannot. You can find a better buzz in other things buddy, quit it before it becomes a habit. If I go too long without a stoge I start to sweat and get cold shakes; I cough up black shit.

I also could not stop laughing my ass off, since the video was this crazy cartoon POV bikeride thing.

Not really a question, but your show in San Jose (hint: we went to the same high school, I was also a student of Mr. Healy's lol) some years back was my first EDM show ever and also the night of my first kiss on top of that.

ummutellme,"Recently started Zoloft (month ago) not feeling any relief, might be even worse. I just have questions about my symptoms overall. 

If depression is a mood disorder that is thought to be related to low serotonin levels, then how can things other than mood be affected? how come I can think straight and experience feelings of dissociation? how come I feel like my IQ has dropped? I know you may not have all the answers but I'm worried that even if I do get higher serotonin levels, how do I know those will help with all this cognitive dysfunction I feel like I have? I've heard depression presents itself different with everyone, but it feels like so much more than a mood disorder. Is a mood medicine really supposed to help all those things?",20M here. i had this pretty bad before I started zoloft and it has kinda continued (I'm a few weeks in). I'm hoping the medication just hasn't hit me yet and this fogginess in my brain will get better.

Granted, my life has had a lot of change over the past two years with college, loss of childhood home, and now a pandemic.

This option has entered my mind before. I'm thinking about it. A part of me hopes Zoloft will bring clarity on whether it is the right decision. At the end of the day, there are some good guys in the fraternity who I'm sure I could become friends with if I wasn't struggling with anxiety or depression. I know there is value it can bring me, I just hope Zoloft helps me with that. 

In regards to the ""pussy"" comment, I appreciate that. I think what I'm feeling is that I used to feel more confident, didn't get pushed around, more dominant I guess. I was more comfortable. Now, at college, it feels like I am treated like a joke (maybe my own fault with how I acted when I got to school).

Can you give me some hope,"Hey, I've posted a few times but I really need some hope today. I'd love to hear some of your success stories. 

For some context on my story, I was a really happy and healthy kid in high school. I had friends, a relationship, and good grades. I was popular but got along with everybody. I don't mean to sound conceded but I was honestly very proud of who I was. I was a good person who did the right thing most of the time. I had issues with depression in middle school (only for a couple months) but I thought that time of my life was over and I had finally moved on. 

When I went to college I think I was desperate for a certain kind of life. I pledged a fraternity because I wanted to ""be cool"" on campus and party. While I did make it into one, I quickly found myself not acting like myself and being the butt of the jokes within the fraternity. I found myself unable to be act like myself. Through time, I became known as this kind of timid, soft, pussy, that I wasn't known as in high school. This gave me such an identity crisis that I had horrible anxiety starting in the fall of 2019. It got worse and worse after a bad drug experience and I started having panic attacks and experiencing pretty intense anxiety around my fraternity brothers. Fast forward to the pandemic hitting and me slipping into a severe depression. Foggy head, no self-esteem, hopelessness...the whole nine yards. Nothing made sense in my head. It was quite scary. don't know if I'll ever feel the way I felt in high school. I don't know if I'll ever feel content and comfortable again. I feel really lost.

 I started seeing a therapist and I'm also on Zoloft. I'm not sure exactly what Zoloft will do. Idk, I hope it helps me a lot.

Nothing makes sense cuz my cognitive thinking is so blurry. I'm very distorted. I'm hoping the Zoloft helps with that.","thank you. needed to hear this. i need to hear this everyday. 

I've been on zoloft for only about a week. I worry that my problems are unfixable by meds. i just wanna be able to focus on what is important. i wanna feel myself/confident/excited for each day. There's a lot of good things in my life and I'm not able to enjoy them. that's what makes me really upset.","hey, what you're describing is very similar to what I experience. Just wanted to let you know ur not alone. I'm a 20m and a junior in college. Mine is sorta like this:

Nothing around me feels very real. I can't comprehend the most simple of ideas. I don't even know my own thoughts, they have no independence or confidence in my ideas, i feel so weak. When I'm around my family, I feel like I barely even know them. My family is actually really close but I feel a layer between us and can't relate to people. Others cant even notice. I'm on autopilot and they cant even tell. No one feels like the same person and I'm worried it is getting worse. I don’t react the same way to things. I second guess every thing I wanna say. 

 I see how people react in movies and tv and I think how I used to react that way but now I'm lose. Idk if that makes sense.

I don't feel myself. I don't even know who I used to be, but I miss him. I feel like I'm so fragile. I'm a shell of what I once was.

Ringing any bells?"
hanamilove,"do you think that perhaps you also self-perpetuate this narrative after you meet a group of new people (not asking from a judgmental perspective only thinking out loud)? i am very similar in that i feel like nobody would give a damn if say tomorrow i dropped off the face of the earth but i also recognize this is the story i've always told myself and its 90 percent based on just the pesky little voices in my head rather than reality and hard facts. after you meet people the next day do you think 'well they don't want to get to know me any further so that was it back to the same old routine of making useless connections that never go deeper'?

i know there are also ways in which i act that may turn somebody off and i am always trying to be mindful of what i say and how it comes across. and that's taken a lot of work. that being said, i'll always be far from perfect and i won't be everyone's cup of tea. And that's fine. But now I sit with myself after I have met someone and then separate the facts from the self-sabotaging thoughts. And then I follow up if I felt a connection, even if the other person doesn't. Be a main character if you want to feel like one. Passive living opens yourself up to just reacting to other people's energies I think. 

 If you haven't done that you can spend some time looking inwards, studying yourself and examining your past but apart from that, make sure you aren't hurting  yourself with incorrect storylines (not saying you do but)

Joseph Campbell says ""I don't see the world as it is. I see the world as I am"".

I see posts on here about those that have just lost a loved one, and almost always delete my responses before I am able to post them.

It feels heartbreaking and I feel helpless when I read about those who have just lost someone. But I don't have the words to express anything.

Sometimes I see interviews (I sound very naive - yes, i know interviews are when people put their best foot forward) and when people talk about how losing a loved one gave them an appreciation of life, it makes me feel so lost. I don't feel like my mom's there guiding me. All I know is she isn't here anymore. I quit my career to become her caregiver and now that I am trying to get back into the professional world, I am trying to switch careers but I don't even know for sure what I am going to end up in or if I am going to do well at all. I don't feel that 'appreciation for life' because 'we only get to live it once'. It's mostly just being numb and pretending to move forward and fooling myself into feeling motivated.

Then he would have one beer and say it was just one I’m good. But then he’d start having one every other day. Then he would have more and more until he shows up as the drunk asshole he turns into when he has more than a few and at this point, we just don’t say anything. He lies. We stay silent. He drinks but doesn’t engage. We stay silent. We just don’t have anything left in us. We lost our mom four months ago and we’re all just depleted.

The worst thing was tho seeing how he empties them. For me then as a kid, a 6 or 8 years old boy, this was me seeing losing my dad for this evening in seconds. 

I remember especially two situations. Once we were waiting for the champions league final. I was preparing for weeks for this. I was saving my pocket money, I bought my dad's favorite sausage, bread, snacks, bought some chips. When I was preparing the setup for the match next to the crisps I found an empty bottle. Wet. I knew its over. Broke my heart

Second situation was when we were supposed to go to see a handball match. Same as above. I had a backpack full of snacks I bought. I went out to the car and saw my dad emptying a 200ml bottle of vodka. I broke down this time. I started to scream, yell, cry, this literally effed me up.

This was also when my mother had enough and filed for a divorce. 

Writing this to tell you - this breaks your family to see it.  

But now the good part. When sober my dad was the best. And he still is. And he is a fantastic grandfather and a fantastic father now. We talk pretty much daily. He always supports me. He always is there for a talk, to come over to the little one. After the divorce he changed because he did not want to lose me. And he did it! Full style! I know he had some troubles, but managed to overcome it just to keep in the contact. 

Look for help mate. You can fix that. And you should. And it's hard AF, but worth it. 

Also to say - all this made me not drink in front of my kids. My kids never saw me drunk, barely in the last 4 years they saw me drinking a beer evening's or even during some sport events. If I want to have a beer and watch a match - I record it and when I put my kids to sleep I have a few beers maybe, but I've never been wasted at home. 


Sorry for the long post, but that image brought some memories. 

Cheers! Fingers crossed mate!","I hope mate you're doing well now, or at least heading towards being ok. 

Where I live (Poland) access to public health diagnostics is quite easy. Also I have a very high private medical care sponsored by my company where colonoscopy prescription is given over phone. And even if that fails a private colonoscppy is like 150USD so very manageable. 

I know in US this is a different story. 

Anyway I always encourage to make diagnostics. One too much is better than one too less. Im 32 and had colonoscopy, gastroscopy, short rectum colonoscopy, doing every year extended blood tests, doing ultrasonic scans of my belly every year too. 

Considering myself lucky I have access to all of this for literally pennies. 

All the best mate!","If someone can't afford Mighty - try to get Crafty. Or Crafty+ 

Pretty much same vapor quality but a smaller, less battery life and no display. 

Also one vaporizer that is often overseen but its cheap and provides a good cloud (not like mighty tho) is Boundless CF. Especially with the bong connector.","Dynavap actually is. Probably the most efficient vaporizer. 

Volcano us dope too. Especially if you use the balloon. Loved that feature!","Mighty is an amazing device too. A few of my friends use it. Volcano as well actually. Owed one for some time. 

I think its up to what you like a prefer. For me any weed tastes like shit so I treat it like vodka - just get this into my body asap. Dynavap is perfect for this. 

But for people enjoying the taste - you're probably right. Dynavap is more nasty then the rest. 

Inb4 ""try different strains for taste"" - been spending half of my life before covid in amsterdam and I just don't like how weed tastes. Love the effects tho","Still reading the comments and just saw you're experiencing neuropathic issues. 

As mentioned had history in my family. What helped my relative with this issues was (I know it will sound silly) - office desk yoga. 

Doesn't require much energy nor coordination etc. Would ask the MD before doing it, but can't imagine it can cause harm on the other hand. 

Just wanted to add. All the best mate!","Looking at the color you're undervaping it. I'd consider it half baked. 

Thats actually good for ABV as its still quite potent. 

Grind it in a blender. Cover it with some oil (i usually use high quality olive oil - good olive oil is not bitter. Use a neutral oil if you don't have access to good olive oil). 

Give it a hot water bath (slightly below boiling point - 90-95 degrees Celsius) for ca. 2 hours. Don't fry it! Just trigger and speed up the reaction. Shake it every 15 minutes (use a silicone oven glove). 

Then place it in a dark place, room temperature. After ca 24hr run it through a cheesecloth. Voila! Use it for food or just eat with a spoon. Try with small doses as edibles dont build tolerance through smoking, so you may end up like a noob after a tablespoon even tho you can rip 10 bongs in a row. 

Pro tip:

Keep the cheesecloth  - just throw it later on in a sauce for example. Will keep you high 

Keep the drained weed if you want. Should be potent enough for a joghurt. Its nasty, but if you run out of stash - gonna be ok. You can keep it in the freezer for ever pretty much. Make sure its properly sealed tho. 

Yeah, thats it. 

I also would recommend to get a dynavap as a portable vaporizer. Its really amazing how efficient it is. You will notice the difference in ABV immediately. 0.2g is from dynavap is like 1g from volcano. Thats how efficient it is. 

Enjoy it mate!","I read through some comments - you detected it via blood in stool. So its the lower part of the colon perhaps close to anus right? Otherwise blood would be more dark, close to brown, black if it would go through a longer bowel path. 

Asking cause I have a history for colon cancer. I had 5 years ago my first colonoscopy, this year the short version of it (just the lower part) and being scheduled in 3 years for another colonoscopy as in my age (32) its recommended to do it each 8 years the full one and the short one in halfway. 

I have blood very often and freaks me put every time, but apparently its just minor hemorrhoids. 

But my lifestyle needs to change. Not carrying myself recently very well

Good luck mate!","The water bath should be slightly below boiling point. Just to add to the recipe :) 

Can't be to low either. Something between 90-95 degrees Celsius. 

Enjoy. Tastes great even without any food. Just with the spoon.","Here is what I do with my ABV (and I use Dynavap so your stash looks half baked to me, which is a good thing in case of reusing ABV):

I grind it in a blender into almost a powder. I add high quality olive oil (must be a good one so its not bitter, otherwise use some neutral tasting oil) and make a hot water bath for ca. 2 hours. I dont want to have a very high temperature, I dont want to fry the stash, but want to trigger and speed up the reaction. 

I shake it every 15 min (use oven gloves wrapped in some foil, so its waterproof. Wet gloves dont work. Or get a silicone one).

Ever since I had an existential crisis a few years ago, where I came to The conclusion that nothing really matters, and that I should just try to experience as many good feelings as I could, I've sort of lost my soul.

I've become depressed, and I've also started to view problems as jokes, so I just laugh at my shortcomings, problems, etc..., cuz nothing matters right? I've also been let down by mean and uncaring people so many times, that I've been trying to avoid helping others, which really hurts me deep down. I've also been convinced, that a male with such  characteristics doesn't really fit into this world, which gets me even more lost.

I have been letting her use a car that was gifted to me (since she doesn't have one) and made it clear that she would keep it clean or else I would take away the keys. I brought this proposition up to her because she is known to let garbage pile up in everything she owns, whether it be a car or a house.

Well today, I happened to ride in the car to the store with her and it was horrid. It was FULL of empty drink cans, food wrappers, and used napkins. Not to mention that this wasn't the first time it had looked like this either. On 3 separate occasions, I have had to clean up after her and let her off with a warning each time. 

This time I was cleaning it out, I tried to tell her in the nicest way possible that she had agreed to keep the car clean and that I wanted it to continue to stay that way fron here on out. She had gotten extremely offended, began to personally insult me, and wouldn't stop following me around to bitch in my ear so I just snapped.

At first, I took the keys and hid them so she wouldn't be able to use the car but she argued that she had put the gas in the tank and wanted to use the rest of it. It was a fair request, so I complied and told her she could use the rest of the tank tonight and that she needed to lay the keys on the kitchen table when she got back.

She still kept messaging me trying to keep the argument going, so I just let her ramble on until she was done and sort-of skimmed over the messages. I sent her a text in response not too long ago and pretty much told her that I hated having to clean up after her messes when she could just throw her garbage away or AT LEAST put it in a bag and tie it up to dispose of later, like a normal person. I also told her that everyone in the family was tired of her being content with living in filth and while we did still love her, she needed to get some kind of professional help before we could continue to support her.

He just assumed that the smaller bottle is the conditioner and never tried to read it.

He blamed it on the shampoo he was currently using (it was not as bad with his previous shampoo, according to him). So, we went to the store and he bought a bottle of shampoo he was using earlier along with the small conditioner bottle.

He went back yesterday and today he tells me that he noticed something about the conditioner. That it was not a conditioner at all. He bought one big and one small bottle of the same shampoo. He did the same with his previous shampoo (the one which worsened his scalp) and also when he bought the current shampoo earlier in the first place (he had the bottles).

So, all that time, with three sets of purchasing the products, he was shampooing his hair from the bigger bottle, washing it, applying the shampoo again from the smaller bottle, keeping it on for minute, waiting, and then washing it again.

Also, since all were anti-dandruff shampoos, using them without conditioners is the worst you can do to your dry scalp.

Normally I don't remember my dreams but maybe I get one every few years most of them are nonsensical stories usually involving me completing some quest.

It started in a makeshift village in a place I don't go to often the bulk of it being filled with with people. For some reason I leave the village on one of those carts you would ride on in elementary school PE. Riding down a familiar road that's for some reason really hilly I notice that I'm going quite fast. 
(This is on a public highway.)

In an attempt to stop and go home I basically drift into someone's driveway. Doing this someone almost runs over me in a car. My heart rate high I make the attempt to climb up one of the hills so I can get back. Going up this hill is as difficult as you would imagine as it's comically steep. 

Trying to crawl on my hands and knees a piece of the hot asphalt I grabbed crawling on breaks and I fall down. I notice a sedan behind me just parked sideways to the highway watching me.
Felling rushed as I thought I was still blocking the person's driveway I climb again thinking I should ask them for a ride.
I don't for whatever reason and keep climbing. 

I get up almost all the way there and notice the world has changed. There is now asphalt behind me as I crawl and at this point I have to use it as the hill is so steep. As I attempt to grab the other asphalt I notice that the sedan has followed me but is still parked sideways. 

I look in the window and there is a woman in her early to mid twenties watching me climb. She seemed curious to whether I can make it up the hill. A was smile on her face as she kept watching. It seemed I had the same question as her. Could I make it? An image ran through my mind of me falling again only this time to my death. I was so high up I was sure my skin would rub off before I hit the bottom. That is where the dream ends.

Bottom line is that the only reason he loses his powers is so that Mysterio could be any sort of threat, and how this subplot of him losing his powers felt shoehorned in, or at least not properly fleshed out.

i just wanted to share my experience having a medical termination in Wales UK last year. this is EXACTLY what happened, no details left out. 

so i found out i was pregnant on Oct 4 2019, at 19yo, and i was with a very abusive guy, in literally EVERY aspect of the word. i decided it was not only in my best interest, but in the 
/pending/ baby’s best interest as well. 

i’m bad with remembering the names of the pills i had and honestly i don’t really want to remember the exact names but i took the pill that ended the pregnancy on 25/11/19 and then went in at 7am on 27/11/19 (11wks) to insert the pills into my vagina that would help me pass the pregnancy. 

i had a very traumatic experience with passing the pregnancy, and this is in no way meant to scare anyone or frighten anyone in any way shape or form because every single persons terminations are different. 

after i inserted the tablets, i had to lay very still completely flat for an hour, and then i was free to use the bathroom and move around as much as i wanted. at about the 3 hour mark is when the cramps started and i was spending about 20 minutes at a time sat on the toilet. 
after i got to about the 4 and a half hour mark, it got really REALLY intense, the cramps were almost unbearable and i swear i almost passed out a couple times. it was at this point the nurses gave me gas and air to help with the pain and it helped for maybe 40 minutes and then it just wasn’t doing the trick. 
a nurse came in and was very kind with me, she said that she had warned me that the cramps could range from mild period cramps to almost labour like contractions... and lucky old me got the worst of it. 
in the end i had to have 2 shots of morphine in my upper thigh to help the pain as well as the gas and air, so it’s fair to say, i was absolutely off my t!ts. 

/graphic warning so stop reading if you don’t want to know/ 
so for the first like 2/3 hours i was barely bleeding, little to nothing but after i hit about the 4 hours after inserting the pills, it became an absolute waterfall of a mess, i was unable to put trousers on at all or even the mesh underwear things they give you to hold a pad. most of my time was spent squatting on the floor holding onto the bed frame while my dear friend (i scarred him for life) held a bed pan underneath me with one hand and the gas and air in my mouth with the other. 

the actual passing of the pregnancy felt like... almost like a water balloon had fallen out of my vagina. it was extremely painless actually coming out, and it all came out whole, like still in the sack, completely whole which NOBODY prepared me for!!!! nobody told me it would come out like that so please, cautionary tale. 

worst part was actually seeing the pregnancy, it came out and fell into the bed pan my friend was holding, and for some ungodly reason i looked. 

PLEASE, when they warn you NOT to look, DON’T look!!!!! 
it’s something that i can still perfectly picture everyday and i will never be able to erase the image from my mind. 

passing the sac was absolutely easy, just force yourself a big push and it’ll come straight out, just make sure you’re either on the toilet or in a position to catch it because it’s messy, as i found out the hard way. 

SO, post termination, i was bleeding for 2 weeks and just as i was stopping, i actually haemorrhaged and ended up in the hospital on an IV, which was scary, they removed 2 golf ball sized blood clots from my uterus, but luckily the bleeding slowed and i was on my way home again in about 5 hours. 

as you have probably noticed, which is a recurring theme in most of my life, anything that could’ve gone wrong, pretty much did go wrong. i struggled for many months with my decision to have a termination, battled myself on whether i actually believed it was right before humane, got clinically diagnosed with PTSD and just all together had a shit show. 

but ladies, they’s, them’s or whatever you like to be called, 

i am so incredibly thankful that i was able to have this procedure.

olluxe,"I've barely lived for sixteen years and I cant take anything people say in as a grain of salt. I know it's normal to be sensitive, but it is so draining to take every bit of criticism to the heart and I don't think I can take anymore of it. I have no access to proper help, although I do see a counselor- my therapy is quite limited as mental health where I'm from is not taken very seriously.  I can't even look at people in the eyes anymore without feeling like they're judging me and criticizing everything I do and I understand that is inevitable but I hate myself for it. 

Everybody here is so carefree and happy and I'm just the kid who blows up at everything and nothing. I have a great supportive family but I still feel misunderstood. It's been like this for the past four years and my mom said she wouldn't be sure if I'd be able to go to university outside of the continent since I can barely handle anything on my own for too long. 

I'm constantly comparing myself to my sister because shes so happy and bright and everybody loves her and the difference between the  two of us is so massive and its hard knowing  that everybody can see it. I try not to have these thoughts, but they just keep on coming, and I don't think they'll ever go away I feel like I'm alone and I just don't want to keep living a life always feeling like I'm on the edge and that everyone hates me. I hate the way that I feel this way to start with and I'm afraid all of these feelings are evolving into something much greater.

 I'm burdening my family with these thoughts as well, and the occasional outbursts, and I think they're eventually going to get tired of me. I don't think I'll ever be able to find love or do anything because of this, and my little sister told me she doesn't think of me as a role model. I'm just a mess and I don't know what to do with myself. I just don't want to be here anymore.

Our past roommate was freaking out about COVID and left abruptly without giving us a chance to screen potential roommates. Now she has as many rights as a tenant to the place as we do.,"I know this is a huge post. There's a lot of different things going on with this roommate and I've tried to outline them as clearly as possible because I feel way out of my depths with this.

I (25F) am currently rooming with one close friend (24F) and a new roommate (29F) who moved in two months ago. We've been maintaining a strained relationship with the new roommate who has some strange habits and serious hygiene issues but also feels we should always include her in whatever we do.

When this girl first moved in, I was alone in the house and thought it was a typical introvert/extrovert mismatch, but I made extra efforts to be conversational with her because I understood it must be especially difficult moving to a new space during quarantine.  She is a very, very talkative person and very awkward but she seemed lonely and I have tried to be especially sensitive to it because I know quarantine has been tough for a lot of us.

After a while her needs for company became kind of overwhelming to me. On her move-in day I obliged her while she chatted with me for four straight hours. I do tend to be a more introverted person so we had a polite conversation about this a few days later.

I'm also currently working full time during quarantine and have been setting up in the living room with headphones on since I was home alone. She's currently unemployed and would join me as soon as she woke up and sit next to me while I worked, waiting until my work day was over so she could chat me up immediately after. This was extremely draining and felt clingy so I started working in my room with the door closed. She started hanging out in the hallway so that she could catch me to chat whenever I walked out to make food or go to the bathroom. If I went grocery shopping or for a walk she would run to the door as soon as I got back. I asked her directly a couple times to give me some space while I was cooking or trying to use the bathroom but she would only leave me alone for a couple minutes and then come right back.

After two weeks, my friend returned. I was hoping this would help since now the new roommate had more than one person to talk to, but things have gotten worse.

At first, it seemed like she was trying to bribe us into friendship. She would insist on treating us to delivery or baking for us. It was a nice gesture, but it started to make us a bit uncomfortable because she wouldn't accept us politely declining. If we said we didn't want to order takeout because we had food at home she would sulk and not eat.

She has also worn the same outfit and not taken a shower the entire time she has lived with us. There is no soap and no towel in the bathroom and our apartment now smells of body odor and rotting food. She also keeps her toenails and fingernails very very long and when she bites or rips them off she leaves them on tables in common areas. We've found three so far.

Another thing we can't get on the same page about is her grocery habits. She orders groceries online recreationally and our kitchen table is now unusable because it is piled high with her groceries. They're on the floor in the middle of the kitchen and our fridge started to develop a terrible smell as well. We asked her to look through and throw out her stuff multiple times but she would only make excuses. She said she was sunburnt and that it kept her from being able to bend down and pick up her things.

Strangely enough despite repeating the same outfit, she also kept ordering packages of clothing that she would rip open and leave scattered in the hallway but never actually unpack or wear. After a while, we asked her to do something about her packages, either get rid of them or keep them in her room. Right after we had this conversation with her my friend went to the kitchen on other side of the house and I was in the living room, separated by the hallway in the middle. Our roommate came back wearing the clothing she had bought for the first time. She had changed in the middle of the hallway while we were both in the common areas on other sides of the house.

The first time we tried to bring all of this up with her we were sympathetic and said we wanted to make sure she was comfortable and had everything she needed to live here. We assumed she might be depressed and have trouble functioning. She was overall receptive and said that quarantine had given her some bad habits even before she moved in. We asked her if she had someone to call or talk to but she assured us that she was fine. We ended on a positive note and I said that I was glad to hear that she was doing okay and that if she was we expected some things to change.

Honestly, I do believe her when she says she's not depressed. I struggle with depression myself and know that everyone's experience differs and that she may not have been comfortable divulging more but she seemed to get instantly comfortable around us and have infinite energy to socialize and chat.

We felt optimistic following the conversation but things have continued to escalate since then. There appears to be some issue with her room. She has not fully moved in and has been lying about it. After we spoke to her about changing in the hallway the packages remained there for another week. After asking her to move them again multiple times I got frustrated and piled them up in front of her door, assuming she would take them in when she went back. She now alternates between the same two outfits rather than the one. Whenever she's wearing one the other lies crumpled on the floor outside her door along with the other packages.

We asked her again to put them in her room and she said something about how there was no space on her floor. But that's not true. We had to open our doors for a virtual tour which was the first time we saw inside her room. She has been sleeping on a mattress with no sheets and no pillowcase, and has been taking throws from the living room to sleep with. She does not have any other clothes and no suitcase. It appears she moved in with nothing.

She has family a short drive away and her dad has visited a once or twice (though we have never met him), but he has apparently at no point dropped off any basic toiletries or clothing for her. We had yet another conversation and tried to bring this up with her but she consistently denies it and won't be honest with us. She plays dumb and says things like ""oh I was working on my computer"" and ""I just started redecorating"" even though we know her room is bare and dusty apart from the minimal furniture that came with it.

She also never spends time in her room apart from to sleep and goes to the living room first thing in the morning when she wakes up. She stays there, not moving, not using the TV, not doing anything until 1 am when she goes to bed. On days my friend or I have tried to grab the living room to work from home she will still come and joins us which is a bit distracting because she hovers waiting for us to remove our headphones and interact. When we've asked if she could give us some space to focus, she will linger in the doorway outside the living room staying in sight but never officially stepping inside.

She does leave for a couple hours each day when she has a screaming fight with her family on the phone one block away from our house. I don't think she knows we can see or hear her from the apartment but she yells, stomps her feet, and goes red in the face. The last time her dad visited we saw her through the window waving her arms threateningly and yelling at him in person. He didn't seem to fight back. She seems to really loathe her family but her main complaint is that they didn't cook enough for her when she was home and that made her feel like she needed to fend for herself. (This seems silly to me because she's nearly 30 and her family already pays her bills since she's jobless).

After a month of living with her, my friend and I asked if we could have the living room to ourselves for **one night** to video chat with a couple of our mutual friends. She said yes but then sulked and sat in the middle of the floor in the kitchen while we chatted. I had to walk around her to refill my water bottle in the middle of the video chat and when I got to the kitchen she asked me if I was still chatting, clearly waiting to go back to the living room. I said yes. She then confronted me and said she felt like I wasn't talking to her and acknowledging her presence enough and that she had a right to be in the common spaces too. This baffled me because, like I said, this was the first day we had asked for the room to ourselves. We had tried to use it to work but could never get her to stop hovering so we would eventually just retreat to our rooms.

We also had been joining her in the living room in the evenings a couple days a week but on certain days would stay in our respective rooms because we just didn't have the energy to interact after a long work day. We have felt put off by these strange habits and her lack of respect for our living spaces.

I said that it wasn't our intention and that we definitely had a more relaxed way of hanging out. We prefer to watch TV together whereas she always wants to chat. She went on about how she would normally spend more time outside the house but now she couldn't and her roommates wouldn't interact with her enough. After her pressing for a while I was honest with her and said that I felt we were still interacting within our comfort level and that I didn't know if I could be her best friend right now. My friend eventually noticed I had been gone for a while and joined me. It really felt like this new roommate was disappointed that we weren't willing to fill the interaction quota she needed, but we're her roommates. It's not our responsibility to also be her friend, parent, maid, and therapist. We also brought up the cleanliness things again. We've tried politely. We've tried being firm. We've tried joking with her about it. We tried giving her a deadline. We were civil but curt because honestly we've been trying to communicate this so over and over again. We are not obliged to be her friend or pick up after her.

What's strange is also that she is extremely awkward and she seems like she doesn't have many friends which does elicit pity. She also has all of these weird habits which make me think she's not fully mentally stable, but she's weirdly lucid and pushy when she's fighting back with us.

Since then, we have gotten a bit colder with her. We found a rotting banana in the bag and told her firmly, once again, that it needed to be cleaned up and that it was smelling up the kitchen. She threw away the one banana and then moved all her groceries from the floor into the dining room chairs. When we told her to put them AWAY not just on a different surface she said that if it bothered us so much we should just go ahead and throw her things out for her. This feels extremely entitled to me. Again, I am not her parent or maid.  We know she is allowed to be in the common areas but because she always takes over the living room, we have started hanging out on the porch.

The last straw came this past weekend. I walked out of my room to use the bathroom and found her running away from me completely naked in the hallway. Her room is at the other end of the house.

Yesterday we had yet another conversation. We outlined that we understood she had developed bad habits during quarantine but that it was absolutely not okay for her to be naked in the common areas. We asked her again if she had everything she needed to live here. She deflected all of our questions and said she felt like we weren't even treating her like a human being, that it hurt her to hear us laughing on the porch when she wasn't included, and that it made her willfully not want to do anything we asked of her. She was basically trying to infer that if we wanted her to pick up after herself we needed to have more conversations with her throughout the day about things unrelated to the cleanliness of the house.

I am at my wit's end. We have been so patient with her and it seems like she's withholding cleanliness until we agree to be her friend and spend more time chatting with her. I also have absolutely no idea what is going on in terms of her screaming conversations with her family, the nudity, her smell and hygiene, and her lying about moving in.

I love this apartment. I feel like we've fully furnished and kept up the common spaces and made them comfortable so that she could take advantage of them. We only have 3 months left here after which I'm moving cities so I would prefer not to have to move within then but it's starting to seem like the only option. This got away from me for a bit, but thank you for reading.

tl;dr: Roommate doesn't shower, leaves nail clippings out, was naked in the hallway, and hasn't moved in with any belongings for months. When we try to confront her she tries to leverage our friendship for basic cleanliness.

**Edit:** Thank you guys for all your input. My roommate and I are going to give it a couple days for our last conversation to sit. In the meantime we're trying to come up with a plan of what to say if we involve landlords/parents or want to ask her to move out.

I know her being on the autism spectrum was mentioned. This did cross my mind at first because she was chatty and awkward but wasn't displaying any extreme behavior. I don't have enough experience to say for sure, but part of what made me think it was something else was the manipulation. She also seems most lucid and together when she's having these uncomfortable roommate discussions with us, even if her demands (like having more conversations with her) aren't reasonable. I don't know if this fits but it's bizarre."
NachoPoison,"Il try and explain this the best I can. I'm a dude, 18 years old.
My depression and feelings of worthlessness started when I was about 10 years old. So everything was fine until my mother got really strict about me studying and having good grades. Back then when I was small I tried my best to study and do good, however, it was never enough for my mother. Every time I got a decent grade she would say that having a ""medium grade"" was awful and that I shouldn't be happy with that and should always get a perfect grade. Obviously this took a toll on me as I was never able to meet her expectations. I stopped having any motivation to study, which just made things worse. My mother would get mad at me more often, and yell that I was lazy. Eventually, I would cry before going to sleep, calling myself worthless, useless, and a waste of space. This went on until I was about 14 years old. Eventually I came to accept the fact I was a failure, and that I didn't deserve to live on this planet. I did try talking to my mother about how I felt once, however, all she said was ""What are you talking about? Stop joking"". And I could see in her face that she didn't belive I was depressed, she even got annoyed. So I never tried talking to her about it again. So after somewhat accepting that I'm a failure my depression died down a bit. I still felt like I didn't deserve to live, and that I was worthless. But I didn't cry myself to sleep every night so that was a plus. I have though about taking my life many times over the years. Once almost actually doing it by jumping off the roof of the building we lived in. But I backed off and decided not to. So after that things were ""alright"" for a while, yes I would get occasionally depressed, and my feelings 9f worthlessness would come back. But I was able to manage.
Now the reason I'm writing this is because, recently my gf and I has sex for the first time. And one of my biggest insecurities is that my penis is small. Obviously as a teen I had to Google to find out. Turned out it was average so nothing special there. However yesterday my girlfriend and I were talking on the phone, and I made a joke how my penis was small, she agreed to match the joke and everything was fine. Then I decided to ask her what she really thinks about what i have ""down there"".
And sadly, she said that for her it was small. This honestly destroyed me. One of my biggest insecurities turned out to be true. I immediately felt like shit after the told me that.
She tried talking to me, and telling me she doesn't mind and that she loves me for who I am. But how can I ever feel good about myself, knowing that even my dick is worthless. That night I cried myself to sleep. I had hope that at least when I lost my virginity, at least that would be fine, at least there I would be happy. But no. I'm worthless, in every aspect of my life. I'm a complete fucking failure in everything I do.
Now after she told me the truth, I truly appreciated it, however, my self confidence is gone. My ego is ruined completely and I feel just like when I was a child and would cry myself to sleep. Basically, I will never be good at anything in this life, no matter what I do. I feel empty.

2 days ago i found out that the first girl is dating a guy who had a crush on her too. i had a panic-attack and was in my bed since then.

What I have problem with is that this post says if you are skinny and someone says you should gain weight you feel hurt. Like someone says hey dude you need to eat more and then you start crying and go on reddit saying it hurts you like WTF...That isnt hurtful at all.....Why would you feel hurt ???? Also saying someone needs to lose weight isnt bad at all....Its for their health......I dont get it,Actually I am skinny and people did say a lot of things to me but I dont care about them.... And I sure as hell dont whine about it on social media cause I dont get offended so easily... People just want an excuse to feel opressed and whine about it jesus christ grow up... It isnt fun I know that and I have been bullied a lot of times but so what.. But maybe I am like this cause I am from Russia but yeah....I need to gain weight so I dont get offended when someone tells me I need to do that and also fat people need to lose weight....Now if someone has anorexia they need help and people shouldnt make fun of them,Well ok.....

Good work!  Those bullies must really regret treating you badly now.","###Build Help:

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes I have.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

1) To edit videos in a moderately-fast rate.  The reason why I say ""moderately-fast"" is because my schedule is getting pretty packed and I barely have the time to edit, so the less downtime rendering, the better.  I'm a youtuber who loves making content from time to time.

2) I also intend to do some casual gaming, playing games like Overwatch and anything I can pick up and play for around 1 hour before doing something else.  However, if there's a promising title that is a bit demanding, I want to at least play it (ie. Witcher 3, love that game) at a good performance.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

1) I want a great 1080p experience.  I often times play at 1280x720 due to the performance boost.

2) The frame rate I want consistently is around 45-60+ fps.  Additionally, I do NOT want fps spikes to ruin my gameplay.

3) Medium to Ultra Settings.  I don't care for Max settings due to my eyes getting worse by the minute.  However, at the end of the day, it's the game-play that matters most.  If I need to tone down my settings, I will.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Around 500-1000 in USD.  I'm willing to spend ~$200 more, but only if it's REALLY necessary.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

United States

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please).**

Thank you very much for your time! :)","If you crash in the game, you crash in real life!",And you don't?!  It's time to up your game.,"Ummm, I'm going to need 20 minutes in my room.  Preferably alone...","""Good luck @ having fun""",Good af,"How.  No homo, but you're sexy af.

Grats on earning your hotness.  Keep them gains comin'!",Because people can't aim worth shit with her.,Me?  There is no me.  What are you talking about?,"So around 2 days ago, I was meditating.  During the meditation, there was a sudden pop at the top of my head.  Shortly after, I felt a liquid run down the back of my head.  I felt some sharp pains (A scale of 7/10 in terms of pain) when it was running down.  


After a few seconds, the pain stopped I didn't feel the liquid running down anymore.  I've been feeling okay for the past few days, but I'm a little worried that this may be something more.  


Am I going to be okay?",I went through the same thing you went.  My depression is basically non-existent now,si,Witcher 3's new DLC looks great!,So awesome!,omg this happened to me too!,"Worth every fucking penny.  Got 230 hours in, so worth.","Start small, and build it up.

============

I live by the ""Non-zero"" system.  Which means I need to do at least ONE productive/useful/helpful thing everyday.  This includes, but not limited to: Reading, exercising, meditating, etc. <-- Basically things that HELP you grow.  Playing video games doesn't count.

===========

So if I could do ONE thing, why not two?  Three? Four?  You see, ANYTHING is better than zero at the moment.  Sooner or later, it'll become habit, this is good.  Know why?  We are creatures of habit.

===========

Go to the /r/getdisciplined subreddit and try things out for yourself.  Like with I said with another person, different strokes for different folks.  I found out what worked for me and I pray that you'll find what'll work for you as well.  Best wishes!",Pam param,I wouldn't count on it.,Different strokes for different folks!,"You remind me a lot of myself at your age, so I'm just gonna be brutally honest with you, so forgive me for my language:


Yes you can, but it's going to be fucking hard, like REAL fucking hard.  Your old self is always trying to pull you back.


But do you really want to go back at that time?  FUCK NO.  That's why you're here.  Congrats, you completed the first step, now you have a whole lot of shit to get through.


Do/try whatever you think would work.  Whether it's religion, exercise, ANYTHING.  You're only 19, I'm 23 and I'm still going through this.  But it's fine, you realize that you have to change.  You NEED to change...not for your mom, dad, gf/bf, but for YOURSELF.


Here's a few tips I have for you:


-Know what people mean when it comes to cutting out toxic relationships (this is important because you may burn bridges and regret it later)

-REALLY learn how to discipline yourself (motivation can only get you so far)

-Find a hobby AND marketable skill that you're at least DECENT at and improve the FUCK outta it like your life depended on it (BECAUSE IT DOES)

-Meditate and exercise (there are subreddits for these, look 'em up)

-And lastly and most importantly, be kind to yourself.  Don't beat yourself up, but don't baby yourself either.


I'm just a stranger, but please remember that you ARE worth it.  Don't believe me?  Fucking prove it to yourself and ONLY yourself.  You have to be selfish, you HAVE to.  If not, you're only going to be pushed aside and realize how truly cold the world is.  It's do or die my friend.

TC1851,"You and I were perfect for each other in every way. Both successful people with strong moral values. Your intelligence, ambition, success, morals, values, character, kindness, affinity for kids, something I've never seen in anyone else. You and I both share all these qualities. Beyond that, we had great long conversations and got along really well.

The only real difference between us is privilege. You grow up wealthy, I grew up middle class. You are white, I am brown. You are a woman, I am a man (and yes, women are privileged in western society; something I never stated to you but am bringing up in this unsent letter). You are attractive, I am a average.

You are everything I ever dreamed of having in a partner. Never have I met anyone else, before or since. Nor do I think I ever will. I have been through so much difficulty in life, you were my happily ever after, or so I thought. But since you rejected me 2.5 years ago, my life has only gotten worse with no happy ending in sight.

Was my lack of privilege all it took to deny me your love. No matter how perfect we were for each other, does me not being as privileged mean that I am inherently unworthy of having a happy ending? That I must continue to suffer while you continue to have all the good cards in life?","Cass and Varian both feel unappreciated by their Father's, despite their best effort. (Thinking about it Rapunzel and Eugene also have issues with their Fathers on the show; I am wondering if the creator team had issues growing up. Not saying this aa a slur, I could relate to Varian, Cass, and Raps vis-a-vis issues with my Father. I am 24 and still relate to those issues.

Anyways, Cassandra struggles with the same issues Varian does. She also struggles to make her Father proud. Despite all that she brings to the table, her Father sees her as being unworthy of the guards. The show seems to indicate that he was harsh and strict with her; not really appreciating her nor caring for what she wanted. 

Varian's Father on the other hand did love and care for him; but failed to be open and forthright with him. He failed to trust him or see him for the highly competent teen which he was, and still viewed him as a kid. While he himself engaged in adventures, he seeked to restrict his kid.

That being said, I do think that Cass should have had her own version, and that her version would in fact have been superior; she seems to have a stronger case for it.

I'll add their unfulfilled desires to make their Father proud to my list on how Varian and Cassandra's character arcs compliment each other, while also have key differences based on their life went along. Essentially similliar but different, which is what Varian and Cass both are.","I have a 26"" hybrid bike. The front tires are worn.

MilkshakeO,"Hi. You can call me Micah and I’ve lived with shitty parents my entire life. I’ve been traumatized by them and just mentally and even physically abused by them.  I’ve found out i’ve had clinical depression for a year now and take medication. Recently i’ve met the love of my life and I just love her but I just can’t take this horrible household any longer. Everyday it’s a new issue happening and i’m always at fault. I have no where to go and I don’t want to go back to the psych ward.

I stopped watching porn a long time ago because the girls on there aren't like her sometimes I think about taking a knife and cutting my wrists I love her so much I don't want to die knowing there might have been a chance but I'm so awkward she said what are you doing to me in the hall and I paused for a second and said nothing what an idiot I just stared into her eyes and walked away. I don't want to feel like this but just the thought of not being with her. I don't want to live without her. I asked her what she thought of me (over text)and she said ""idk 😐""

I said she is so beautiful and she said I'm not that beautiful like what how can she say that she is the only girl that has ever made me feel like this. it kinda hurts tho I don't even know if she likes me I guess not. Some people that know I have been massaging her a little there like have you laid the pipe yet like what does that even mean I'm just trying to talk to her man like what is wrong with you. I love her when I think about her I think about holding her hand hearing her voice omg just seeing her I don't know what they are doing with there life but I'm just trying find someone to love well I found her but it feels like she hasn't found me.,Guys what is happening to me right now so when she texts me I feel so happy but she is so confusing I try to keep the conversation going but I don't know what to say I'm like really sad because I think she doesn't like me the whole day at school I deleted her photo's off my phone then she says hey then all these emotions just go crazy I'm sad then I'm happy and I'm sad again I don't know what's happening does she like me or not God she's making me love her so much more she liked some of my posts I'm so confused I like her so much but I don't understand her what is she doing to me,Yes of course she told me she needed one. I don't vape tho,Well I only like one girl and well I love her voice I wish she would talk to me more and I love the way her hair covers her face sometimes and when she has glasses omg so cute I can't explain it,I'm so shy she knows I like her. when she's near me I literally shake like I'm so scared. I don't even know how to talk to her I just know I can't live without her I've actually recently learned she vapes I was texting her about it and she wanted someone to buy it for her and she will pay them back if I wasn't broke I'd buy it for her. I'd let her keep the money to I don't vape but it's ok I like her so much I've never been so close yet so far from someone I've  loved before God she's responding to my texts maybe shes just being nice but I don't know. I have told her I obsess over her she knows. I would give anything to know what she's thinking God I have so much love for her I just don't know what to do with it. Thank you so much for responding to my texts even if you don't like me thank you for being so nice I can't lie tho it. Hurts thinking that we might not ever be together. I wasn't lieing I cry over you it's just this is my last year of high school and your the only girl that I've ever loved this much maybe that's why I shake because you know I obsess over you and everybody keeps telling me to just go up and talk to you but I can't. what am I even doing? look the point is I love her and she knows if she liked me wouldn't she come up to me. I know this is a mess but I'm a mess so deal with it I love her.
dobbythegreat2,I've been alone all my life. I've never shared anything with anyone. Except with one girl who I was dating. She left me a few months back and I've realised it was so stupid to be so dependent on just one person. I have no friends. I'm 26 and I don't think I can be close to anyone ever again. This is killing me. Maybe that's the right choice.,This is exactly my story. And I'm 26 too. Very introvert. Feels like I've gotten old to make new friends and suddenly become more social. Although I know being among people is important to stay happy. Not sure how to be more outgoing?,Hug,ME!!!,I guess we'll have to work on ourselves and hope for the best,Thanks dude. I hope you stay strong too,She had told me that she misses me but never tried to contact. I don't know how people can act so strong and be so practical.,I agree dude,Me too. Somedays I get weak and text her myself and she ignores me. I feel my texting will only make things bitter. But I am unable to control sometimes.,I'm also kinda in a similar situation. I also live by that hope.,How many years apart?,I meant in real life of course.,"Is it possible that two people break up, meet after a few years and still have feelings for each other. Is it worth it to get into a relationship again in that case?",Never leave behind any burnt bridges. Work on yourself. People who value you will stay. Do not keep any hard feelings. One day at a time,I'm going through the same phase. The best way is to take one day at a time. I do get weak somedays and end up texting her. Although I don't get any response in return and it hurts like hell. I try to watch something that keeps me distracted. It won't happen in a day. Best way is to be better than yesterday. Also knowing that there are people in worse situations than you and they still carry on. Keep hope!

I have gone to two different dermatologists and nothing that they have percribed me has worked, and by nothing I mean that the topical gels, the antibiotics and the face washes have not helped not even a little bit. I have tried many different face wash brands and types, oil free make up products when I wear make up and that's not often and other different solutions to treat acne.
My face is very oily and I feel as if nothing I do helps.

Does any one have any recommendations?

I have thought about using bar soap, because maybe the prescriptions and the other face washes are too harsh and oily for my skin. I'm not sure what to do but I am tired of wasting money on things that dont work!

 Noted benzoyl peroxide only works for a week then my skin does not benefit from it as my face only get more oliy. I need something that will minimize my pores and also controls or minimizes the oil on my face. I will not take accutane due to depression.

So I have OCD some other stuff and also kind of depression(or at least depressed thinking).
I am in a new school. Maybe for two months now. So I went there but still I already missed a lot of days. On monday I didn’t go to school and yesterday I did. Today I didn’t again. My mom is so sad and depressed about it! I really wanna do something against it and go to school till summer break now! Every day!!!! The thing is that I don’t know what I can tell them why missed school so frequently. I thought about telling them about my mental state but I don’t know if I get myself to do that in the moment. Another thing is that I cut my hair and yesterday there where a bunch of assholes who talked behind my back! I know that there are people who have it much worse with getting bullied etc but still what happened yesterday does not make it easier for me. Any device how I can try to just not give a shit what others say? Probably pretty dumb question. Sorry.",Haha first of all thank you xD. I guess I sadly can’t grow out my eyebrows. Because I never really styled them or however you call it(maybe once or twice). Yeah I guess that with the hairstyle I‘ll try. And thanks for the hands xD.,"Omg thank you. That really helps me a lot. Really! 
Yeah I already thought that my glasses could make it harder to pass, but sadly I do not have contacts! Maybe I‘ll try a pair of new glasses soon.

Because I also really don’t want to be in any way mean to people who have an intersex condition! And if they don’t want me to use this to describe myself, I accept that.

I also don’t want to hurt anyone, so would I hurt someone who is cis and has hormone imbalance?
And sorry for my english xD","Okay thank you for you answer. I think I get it. I hope I wasn’t in any way rude asking that question. Didn’t mean to. I am just out of the closet now and I have to learn a lot, so thanks.","Can I tell people that I am intersexual even though I am trans?
I mean actually I was born with both genders. With a female body and a male brain(or thinking or whatever)

I hope I was not mean in any way with this question. I‘m not ashamed to be trans and I also know being intersexual can probably be quite hard to, but I think it would still make me feel less dysphoric.","I never really heard of any girl named Logan.

Today I wanted to call him, so we could agree when I could bring over his belongings or when he comes to pick them up. I have his birthday present here with his name on it. But his phone is off (eve here in Europe) and all I think is, that he already sleeps with someone else.

Anyone here who understands why a higher prolactin level reduces the intensity of a period ?,"Also dealt with trauma, there are meds that make you stop dreaming like Paroxetin or Quetiapin. Please mention it to your doc - it helped me during the first year. when I stabilized enough I slowly got rid off that and only stayed on Effexor. 
Besides, if I got overwhelmed by pain, Ibuprofen 200mg - 400mg also helped me (there are pretty interesting findings on that). 
I went to Trauma therapy for some time and for me suppressing it helped best. Once and Stop. I talked through it once at therapy, never again and then focused on how to cope with symptoms better and how I could move on and improve life. When I have or had a nightmare about it and nasty thoughts came up, it helped me to remind me that I am in the present and that nightmares are just dreams and relate to the past. One technique is to address all senses: what do you see? Describe it in detail. What do you hear? What do you smell? What do you taste? What do you sense ? 
Meditating didn’t help me at all, it would only Hammer problems / issues in my mind. :( 
Also ... there are dreams you can’t control and dreams you can influence. The latter is called lucid dreaming and in my case I am often aware that I am dreaming and then change it. Here is a link for you

Good luck !!","Dear ladies (maybe men have that too), 
Do you experience milk production in your breasts due to taking Effexor ? I take 150mg since two years and ever since I experience that. My period is much lighter now, thus I easily bleed otherwise. 
I am a bit concerned about fertility with that as I am also 36years of age and what else that might do to my body. 
Any thought or / and similar experiences on this? Thanks 😊

This page is run by one of Germany’s research centers for depression. They offer an overview of meds and what was reported about them during pregnancy / impact on mothers help.","Hello everyone, 
I am a runner and loved to go for longer distances. On Effexor I often experience muscle fatigue and have issue even running 3 miles on certain days. I don’t feel muscle weakness / fatigue every day. But on some days I have serious issues performing properly. It feels as my knees would give way any moment. 
There are always up and downs while running, but this is certainly due to taking Effexor. I am on 150mg for 2 years now and pretty stable, but I want to built more stamina and just seem to stagnate with slow 5-10km. 
Does anyone else experience this? Did you reduce your dosage to get rid off this side effect ? Any other Tip for it?","Ach, suffering with you here in Germany where we experience a shortage in supply, too. Talk to your doc however, my psychiatrist told me that there are two other meds they give to patients if Effexor isn’t available in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms or relapse. 
I once went from 300mg down cold Turkey (don’t ask me why I did that) and I lay sick in bed for 3 days. I then couldn’t bear it no longer and took 150mg and after 12h I was back to normal. But it was hell before !!","I started the same treatment 2 years ago. Drugs like Mirtazapine may slow down the metabolism. When I started treatment, I just had lost 12kg (24lbs) in 8 weeks due to depression and weight gain wasn’t a concern to me. I discontinued it after roughly 6 weeks due to the brain fog that wouldn’t allow me to get anything done and binge eating attacks.

If you are very concerned about weight gain (it is also something on my mind), I recommend you to either talk to a nutrionist who is experienced in the field of depression and its treatment and / or count calories. I regularly check my weight, cut sugar from my diet completely and try to go running 3-4 times a week. I also got myself one of the calorie and „eat healthy“ apps. in two years I gained about 5kg (10lbs) - some of that during the Covid lockdown. I am currently working on losing that again. However, I prefer to be healthy and happy over being stick thin, but I get your concern. I also don’t want to be overweight. You may also ask your doctor about Effexor + Wellbutrin (the latter helps against weight gain)",Should have raked the floor like the Finish,Short on Spanish and Italian Index as only waiting for their lockdown,"Hey, erstmal eine starke Leistung, dass du hier so offen schreibst.

Greetings fellow Redditors.

I don't have depression, but several of my friends do. I'm posting this as an open letter to those friends, as well as people with depression and their friends.

Let me start off with a link to this article, which made dealing with these friends a lot less painful: https://themighty.com/2017/05/why-i-ghosted-friend-depression/

Recently, I reconnected with two friends who suffer from depression. Let's call them Anna and Karen (not their real names).

---

Anna is a former coworker. We met at work in 2018. Anna used to break down at work every night and I'd had to cheer her up so she'd stop crying and get back to work. She sang a lot at work, and she is the reason I started formal voice lessons in 2019. She walked off the job in late 2018 after an altercation with another coworker.

In 2019, she walked into my store to order something from another department. She was delighted to see me. I went to the back room to grab something, but when I came back, I saw her leaving the store. I tried to contact her but she never replied.

In 2020, I got a call from her at work. She needed help from another coworker, who I knew would not be willing to help.

I asked her why she didn't add me back on Facebook, and she said that she was afraid I might blow up her DMs.

""Anna, I am literally the nicest and most lawful man in your life. Do you really think I would do that?""

Anna comes from an abusive background and has a hard time understanding that men can be friends with her without wanting to have sex with her.

To no one's surprise, our former coworker refused, and I broke the news to her. She thanked me for helping her. I then thanked her for being a friend.

And that was it. Anna ghosted me again.

It hurts. I know she doesn't mean to hurt me by doing this. I know that she thinks that I'm too pure to be her friend, and is protecting me by staying away from me. Which I find the most hurtful of all, because she surrounds herself with men and women who abuse her.

---

Karen used to work at a gaming store I used to go to. Let's call it the Fiction Store. She was hired by Diana (not her real name) to replace some workers who moved out of town in 2019.

A few months after she started, we became friends, and Karen would tell me about her life (mostly about her family and her struggle with depression). She seemed so lonely, and I listened. Once per week, when both of us were there, she'd talk, and I'd listen.

Then Diana and Diana's adoptive father framed me for stalking her and two customers. I immediately lost all of my non-work friends because they didn't want to associate with a predator. To this day, about half the people I knew still refuse to speak with me.

In 2020, a year after my friends framed me, I reconnected with Karen and got her side of the story. It turns out that our friends/her coworkers lied to her as well. She never hated nor feared me, and best of all, she didn't fall for their cult indoctrination.

I was elated, and almost blew up her DMs before remembering that she had depression and that typing too much might inadvertently hurt her. If and when she replies, it takes her a while to type, and I can see that she keeps deleting and retyping things. I linked her to the article about depression and ghosting, to let her know that I don't take it personally.

I originally planned on meeting her at another gaming store earlier this year, but the COVID-19 pandemic threw a wrench in our plans. It hurts because she's so much more talkative in real life. I have so many things to ask, so many things to say.

And I feel bad for feeling bad. I'm not the center of the universe. I don't want to endanger her or her aging grandmother by meeting her in public and potentially exposing them to the plague.

---

The reason why it hurts so much is because Diana, Karen's boss, was my friend, and around the time she was spreading rumors about me, she was intentionally ghosting me to ""test"" my mental maturity, i.e. she gave me her contact information, told me to contact her, then deliberately didn't reply to see how I would react. I became worried sick about her and she used my deteriorating mental state to ""prove"" to everyone that I was obsessed with her and Karen.

I feel bad whenever I try to reach out to either of them and they don't reply. I feel bad for feeling bad, because I know they don't mean it. Then I feel bad for leaving them alone, because I care about my friends, then feel bad for wanting to message them because I don't want to drain them of energy trying to reply to me.

Interesting.

Some context: My nfriend was the former manager of a public establishment. His gc adoptive daughter was the current manager. He worked as a part-time entry-level employee for the place. He essentially had the responsibilities of a newbie but with the clout of a manager.

I had some insight into how the place was run, and I told people that the place was run like a cult. They recruited young adults with low self-esteem and paid them a pittance for what work they did. They lovebombed them with karaoke nights and parties and even camping trips. They then negged them relentlessly for failing to meet their goals.

Based on what I know about how the place was run, lovebombing and negging was their primary means of keeping the cult in check.","My nfriend, Steven (not his real name), used to swoop in on conversations I had with random people to tell them that I was harmless.

So here's the deal. Y'all probably already know this, but I'm posting this for people coming in from other parts of Reddit.

While it's not illegal to be asexual or any of those other things, it's possible to be mistaken for something else (gay, bi, lesbian) if you're ace.

For some people, queerness is defined by what they're into.

1. Homosexual/Homoromantic - Prefers same sex.
2. Hetero - Prefers opposite sex.
3. Bi - Both.

However, for some people, it's defined by what they're *not* into.

1. Homosexual/Homoromantic - Not into the opposite sex.
2. Hetero - Not into the same sex.
3. Bi - Dislikes neither.

Ace men tend to be mistaken for gay by the second group by virtue of them not being sexually attracted to women. It doesn't matter that they're also not sexually attracted to men, the fact that they're not sexually attracted to women automatically means that they're gay to the second group.

Ace women get mistaken as either prudes or as closeted lesbians.

It doesn't really matter that you're not gay. To the bigots, what matters is that you aren't straight. Or you aren't straight enough.

---

Heck, I live in America. I got asked by two female friends in 2018, on separate occasions, if I was gay or asexual because I never sexually harassed them. The fact that I never hit on them made them assume I was gay or ace. Essentially, they didn't think I was ""straight"" enough to actually be straight.",I'm at work so I can't join the popcorn party,Any Democrat.

I've always been a hsp. I used to worry a lot about everything when I was a child. I was sick a lot, growing up in a very dysfunctional family. At some point in my 20s I became aware that I didn't have a normal stress response. Basically, I don't feel stressed. I have worried thoughts, but I'm able to put them away pretty easily. Instead what happens is my body gets physically ill - usually headaches, sore throat, and/or digestive issues. When those things happen with seemingly no obvious cause, I've learned it's time to do an evaluation and see what might be bothering me.

It's almost like as a child I was so sensitive, and grew up in a very unstable, stressful environment, so in an act of self-preservation my brain just shut off the little guys that tell me I'm stressed to allow me some peace.

Now that I'm in my 40s my body's physical responses to stress has become more extreme - in the past 5 years I've had my gallbladder quit, my ovaries started growing cysts, migraines and cluster headaches from my 20s have returned, and I have full-body pain similar to rheumatism but with no positive tests for anything.

Do you think that might be the case?","I used to share my screen but my laptop overheats. Now I just join for pomos

I needed this!,Just realized I already sent those to you before haha,No it's actually a link to a group chat thing. I'll send it to you,Sure,there's more than one?,"So, do they?",Happy cake day!,\-what,Med student?,Lawn mower,Thank you. May your teeth never give you trouble.,"Yikes! Glad you're all better now.

My exams are done in October so hopefully I can hold up until then..","Like, the gums or the tooth itself?","Yup. Impacted. Did an XRAY and all. I can feel the bump, but it's not coming out. It's hurting the tooth in front of it",How about jumpinchat?,"It's impacted. Was supposed to go get them surgically extracted but covid happened, then my exams.

secheadlessonds,But it’s also capable of completely ruining entire lives.,"Wow thanks, I’ll try all of that. I just started meditation today. I’m no good at it yet, but I think it calmed me down a little.",Did they say anything about how to deal with those feelings if they’re overwhelming? Any tricks?,I hope you find peace and happiness too,"I feel like it’s getting worse, not better. Not sure what to do at this point. My heart is still completely broken.",I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. I feel it too. I fucked up my relationship and now I’m really struggling. I hope you have people you can reach out to for support.,"I’m a month and a half in and I don’t see much progress. I’m plagued by memories all day every day. I cry my eyes out multiple times a day. It’s so fucking hard to not call her, but I know I can’t. And I feel like I’m a burden on my family who probably think I should be over this by now. 

I thought I would have made progress by now but I feel like I’m almost at my lowest and with no support.","I feel like I miss her more and more every day. It’s like I’m dredging up memories I had totally forgotten about just to let them hurt like hell. What were you confused about, if I can ask?",Ah gotcha. It’s taking forever for me too :/,"It took me a year to fully get over my last girlfriend before my recent ex. We were together 4 years on and off. She was the closest thing to a soulmate I thought I’d ever have. 

Now I’m 100% over her and crying over a new ex. Life is funny like that. Don’t worry about the speed of the breakup, you’ll be over her some day and crying about someone new.","Yeah my ex said she never felt like she was my girlfriend. I did try though, I’m just not good at showing affection. She never tried to figure out why. It was frustrating. But now that she’s gone I’m scared that I’ll never thrive again like I did with her. She was always taking me out of my comfort zone and making me do new things. My life just feels empty and bland without her, which makes the memories that much more painful. I was so happy back then.",That sucks. I hope you were able to develop other connections after that. I’m trying to be more outgoing now but it’s hard. All I want is that connection back. All others feel like they’re just not enough.,"I’m afraid that once I move on, which could take months, she won’t want to be my friend any more. But I’ve been told that’s an irrational fear. So maybe take it week by week, and eventually you’ll get over your ex. Then you can go back to a casual friendship, if that works for you. 

Personally I can’t imagine being in a place where I could emotionally deal with seeing her or talking to her over the phone without it triggering me like crazy.","Well, I don’t know if you would even care to try it, but there’s a drug called phenibut that I discovered through an ex whose friend had major social anxiety. She got all her friends into the drug because for people without social anxiety, it becomes something of a party drug as it makes you super outgoing. But with her friend it helped him overcome social anxiety, at least to an extent. It’s legal and you can find it online. The more serious drugs have pretty major side effects that I wouldn’t be comfortable with either. 

Have you considered something more serious than therapy? Maybe consider seeing a psychiatrist instead of just a counselor.","It’s especially hard when you have a hard time making close connections with anyone else, even your best friends and family. My whole family and several of my friends know what I’m going through, but I have to initiate all the conversations with them. They never ask how I’m doing or call me. Every interaction is surface level. I lost the only person who cared about me enough to call me. I lost my companion and my best friend. 

That’s not something that heals quickly.","I tried staying friends with my ex. It was crippling just to get a text from her. Seeing her name in my phone was enough to ruin my day because of how much I miss her. I had to go fill NC even though we could have stayed good friends. I really hate how powerful these emotions are. I feel your pain. I wish I could be her friend, but the pain is way too strong right now.",See a therapist or doctor about your social anxiety. I know people who have extreme social anxiety and have successfully treated it to some degree using medication and therapy.,I did this too. I completely changed my schedule. Instead of gymming in the afternoon I now wake up at 5 and go to bed early. I think changing our schedules can help. It can prevent us from experiencing the same moments we used to with our exes at night.

Difficult, yes, but with any composure or awareness he would have scored or assisted that. Instead he flailed at it.","Yeah facts, like even when Salah has a bad game he still can help us win by forcing things to just *happen*. I’ve seen plenty of times where he’d dribble, lose the ball high up the pitch, and we’d win it back and make something happen. I would take that over disappearing any day.",Because the military doesn’t take expressions of emotions well unless it’s destructive. Crying is perceived as weak.,I’ve found that letting myself feel the emotions doesn’t always make them go away. Sometimes they can ruin whole days. It’s frustrating. If they aren’t strong enough to force tears they can just sit in my chest all day. It’s exhausting.

What resource has worked for you?,My therapist told me that she’s sorry I feel this way and that I just need time. Not the most helpful advice. She didn’t even give me things to try.,Oh I know what they’re telling me. And I know I can’t do anything about it. I’m just wondering how to healthily deal with emotions when the obvious answer is something I know I can’t do.,What if they’re completely overwhelming sometimes?,"I just started feeling like coffee was lying to me. I’d be happy and objective and positive all morning, then it would dump me around 3. I figured I’d rather just feel my authentic emotions than have that disingenuous period in the morning.","I thought things were supposed to slowly get better, but my days are getting increasingly worse. I’m a month + out from the breakup and full NC, but the last 5 days have each been harder than the last. I can’t get the thought of my ex out of my head. The memories are just excruciating, and they don’t stop.

I quit drinking wine before bed (was just one or two small cups) and quit coffee last week (only drank one cup every morning) because I hated knowing that the positive feelings and emotions they gave me are all lies. 

The last 5 days have honestly been some of the hardest of my life, and today was absolute hell. I don’t think I’ve ever cried so much in one day. No positive feelings at all.

Has anyone gone through these protracted downs? Do they last? Are they because I quit coffee and alcohol? It’s not like I was a heavy user. 

I just really need a little positive in my life. I feel like I’m heading for a brick wall."
sinsaroth,"Hello,
I feel like I am falling apart cause of he pandemic. I already was diagnosed with depression and had suicidal thoughts for a very long time. But now I am falling apart. 
It all started with the first lockdown. I was “trapped” with my roommate. He wasn’t the problem we had a lot of fun together and understand each other very well. But then he got a girlfriend. She was visiting him very often and since only two households were allowed I always took the step back so they could get happy together. But I felt lonely back then cause I had no physical contact with any of my friends. 
So later in the year Bars reopened and my drink buddy and I went to the bars as often as possible. But soon he took his boyfriend with him and I felt a stranger there as well, but the alcohol was always helping out and I still enjoyed it. 
After that I was writing my bachelor thesis, so my spare time was liken nonexistent. Then I finished my bachelors degree and wanted to study further. But didn’t get any place to study. So I moved back to my parents and I am thankful for that I can live there.
But this brought older problems back to my mind. I don’t connect much happy thoughts about his place (suicide attempts, losses and heartbreaks). So I wasn’t totally excited of the decision but it was the only option. 
So I moved in and had some good weeks. But soon another lockdown hit me so I wasn’t even able to see anyone of my friends anymore cause of their relation ships. 
This leads to my final problem. I feel more and more alone from day to day. Without a job or possibility to meet my friends. And start to fall into heavy depression again I was hoping I had overcome.",As ADC main I can confirm that,Schlossrunter,"Pros xp after fighting:

I am passionate about designing my own worlds and campaigns for dnd. I am interested in how long you guys need to create a plot and the world where it plays?","My advice is maybe a bit late.  
I always take notes if a idea comes to my mind, no matter where. When I need a new campaign setting I went threw some notes and check them how I can use them to combine them into a cool story.","Is there some sort of a crowd watching them? 
When that’s the case u can let them throw sone things down in the pit. 

Else I would recommend some simple traps like a bear trap or such kind. 
As weapons I could think of the typical martial weapons or some good utility tools like a chain they can take with two members and snare some enemies with it.","Since my campaigns are always way to big, like 200-250 hours I don’t reuse my npcs. I design them to fit in the created world.

As I got in touch with dnd I finally could do this as part of a group and since I am very introverted I have a possibility to get out of me with the stories.

Thanks for the advice.,Do you give the whole XP for killing the encounter and handling it the peaceful way?,Interesting approach. Thanks for the advice.,I just give the XP from the monsters and the encounters are mixed from hard to easy. And I mostly take monsters from the monster manual. But still got the problem.

*Bonk*","Well, it sometimes depends on the subject's personality, but it is true that normally males are generally more violent. I guess its because of the ""strong men protect their loved ones"" trope and the ""alpha male"" mentality, males feel like they need to act more aggressive in order to show they can be respected. Its pretty toxic if you ask me, but its the way things are.

A man that can't act as a hyperagresive, macho man is immediately sought out and attacked by other males in order to prove their own strength, be it physically or mentally attacked. 

You end up learning to ""toughen up"" and put on a front to protect yourself, but it usually has the consequence of acting more agresive towards normal people too, not just other males. It's either that or taking the abuse, most men choose the former.

Hope this answers the question.","Exactly, I was in the bus and now everyone's staring at me like I'm a degenerate!!! Have some decency  people, can't even open reddit nowadays.","Go to horny jail

It was the summer of last year, people were having their graduation parties, and I went to one with my friends and some girls, one of which liked me. I knew then that she fancied me, but I was sure it wouldn't go far, as I didn't like her that much, and I thought it would have been weird to meet later in class and all that. Throughout the night we stayed together, we drank together, and we even went away from the party to sit in a little cliff at the side to look at the stars. She even went as far as using my arm as a pillow, she was clearly giving me an opening, but I was too scared to act, so we stayed like that until we went home.

There's a bot for that, too? Lmao.",That's awful. Hope you and your dog are okay.,"Expectations. 

You should always be confident in everything, you should know everything, you should be able to cope with everything, you should ask women out and learn to accept rejection if you're not attractive without giving up, you should solve everything, you should always be positive, you should be strong physically and mentally, you should make as much money as possible, you shouldn't ask for help, you can't be ill, you can't be hurt, you can't be sad, you shouldn't show emotions in general... even though we are all humans and we have strengths and weaknesses, we are all imperfect, prone to disease, anxiety, depression, not being well informed about everything, not being able to cope with everything, etc.

If you fail to manage any of these, society will proclaim that *you aren't a man.*","Intrinsic negativity. I have been trying to battle that for the last couple years with jokes and all that as a way to have a more positive outlook on problems. My usual reaction to a problem or a potential failure is revelling in negativity. Like for example, I've had a problem with a traumatized tooth (that had gone through gum disease before that) for about 20 days now that won't stop hurting even though my dentist and I were optimistic about it staying alive. Well, it's been a while and it still hurts if I go out and/or talk so its nerve might have to die really soon so that the pain goes away. I can't stop thinking about the procedure, the fact that I'll have a dead frontal (lower) tooth that will likely look bad unless I take more measure regarding its aesthetics, etc... I keep telling myself ""you'll figure it out"" and ""things will be fine"", though.

By the way, I can relate to many of the top comments here, which sucks... Here are a few more:

\- I'm a bit of a perfectionist (not 100% but I do care about little things a bit too much)

\- Change is a little difficult for me, but I have made some major changes during the last 2 years so that's a bit different nowadays

\- I'm a guy, 21, and even though from the outside I might look reserved and even cold (to people who haven't spoken to me, that is), I am emotional sometimes

\- I overshare (like I am doing now, even though you fellow Redditors don't know me personally)

\- I also tend to overthink and overanalyze - I've been trying to change these as well, and nowadays care less about trivial things

\- I dwell on past mistakes and failures

\- I might get attached way too easily

\- By the way, my nickname is not random - it's a consequence of my negativity + joking about it

\- I'm kind of weird (a bit of a renegade, if you want me to be a bit more edgy, lol) when it comes to life - I don't care about many things people care - cars, luxury, having lots of money, etc. I don't even drive. I'm a bad driver and my perfectionism has prevented me from learning how to drive properly (due to anxiety and impatience when I am on the move) and since I live in a bigger city now I've given up on driving.

mirza1995,"Ok, so before i start i want to say everyone is different so what works for me might not work for you but its worth a try. After being depressed for most of my teens and my early adulthood iv always looked for ways to get rid of my depression. It just seemed like i shouldnt really be feeling this way. Now in my early adult life i think i finally figured it out. Im depressed because in my life there is a sin or multiple that im commiting that is making me depressed but was unaware of it. I looked at my life and saw that my depression started when i started doing this, so everytime i would eliminate this sin i would be extremly happy. A week or two in i would feel so happy i want to burst out of my body from the love i feel towards myself i could be sitting on the couch and my happiness level is a 9/10. Then i would slowly start doing the deed again and surley i sart feeling like shit, suicidal thoughts start coming in and it gets worse and worse. Sins could be anything it can be porn, alcohol, lying, adultery, cheating, stealing if you are doing any type of thing that could be labeled as sin please just quit it and see how you feel in a week or two just for experiement.",Improving your life always starts of with the simple things.

Give it a couple more weeks it will look even better, plus if you went to get the barber to shape it up or even if you did it yourself it would look awesome.",No. Just your brain building new healthy pathways.

I have a thick beard just wished it was a different color.","Iv only abstained from porn..i still masturbated, just without any porn.","It looks good, dont shave. Thats your mane now.","This may seem like a weird question, but do you watch porn?","I still masturbate a couple of times per week,but iv given up porn completley about a month ago and wont be going back, and iv already had two girls tell me theres something different about you, youre not like the rest? What makes them come up with this conclusion, maybe the energy of a porn watcher and the one who doesnt watch is different, and since like 95% of guys watch porn maybe you stand out somehow? I would like to hear your views on this.","""Your addict brain is still getting its fix"" yes this is exactly what it feels like even though im not watching porn. Yes, i do want a real woman in my life , and whenever im clean from all this porn/sexting i feel like i connect with women alot easier and more deeper, after relapsing its like the feelings of shame and guilt i have make my experiences with women awkward and much harder to connect intellectually and emotionaly.thanks for the channel suggestion, ill take a look at it.

Im heavily addicted to sexting. I would go on dating apps and find someone to sext with and the topics would get worse and worse. I would get to a month clean and then come back worse then i left.

And around 45 days and onward i started getting tons of friend requests and people messaging me on fb. Before going porn free i never got any friend requests and hardly anyone messaged first , once i went back to porn it all stopped.

Idk might sound dumb."
curious_mindz,"Hello all! I know that the internet is not a place to troubleshoot, diagnose and fix your health problems but I want to give a shot to get some sort of direction.

Over the past year, I feel like nothing has given me a sense of meaning or pleasure. My mood is merely meh and everything feels like a chore.

Out of all my responsibilities, work seems to be the most challenging. I cant stress how fortunate I am to get a job in my current company where I know the barrier to entry is pretty high. Everyone is really helpful and smart but I just dont find the motivation to exceed. In fact my approach has been to stay under the radar, perform as per expectations which was very different a few years ago, which sucks because its a great place to thrive in. I was ambitious, hard working and wanted to move up the career ladder. Now I did have a life changing event 2 years ago when I became a dad. Earlier I could procrastinate on my work but always made up by working ""extra"". For example, things I could accomplish in 40 hours I would take 60 but still get it done. With parenthood, I feel like I need to be really really efficient with my time and all my flaws have been amplified.

I spoke a therapist 4-5 times but it did not really add value. I guess maybe because it was on Zoom but I am not sure. I am not sure if the therapist really understood me. I am willing to talk to someone else but I just want to figure out what i might be going through and be better prepared when I see the next therapist. 

One value add that I can think of is I daydream a lot.... a lot.. and the therapist mentioned that sometimes daydreaming is your body's defense mechanism to cope up against depression. It was almost like your body wants you to daydream so you dont feel depressed. 

Anyway I feel like I am a very different person than I was a couple of years ago and I am just not enjoying it. It has started to trickle in my personal life and I think its not fair to my family that I am going through this. Any help/guidance would greatly be appreciated",Hi Joanna - Hope you are doing well and staying safe. Huge fan of your work! What was it working like John Hawkes in Too Late. I loved the movie and feel its grossly underrated. Hope you have a great rest of the day.,"I am surprised that people say its a sellers market. There are condos in River North, Gold Coast that have been on the market for more than 8 months :\","Maybe I came across lazy but I was not looking for advice, I was looking for a discussion. 

Last week I drove through a townhouse community near lincoln park and saw at least 4 or 5 for sale signs which got me thinking if it was a good decision to buy in the city and if so, will it be a liability in the future (like it was for many who bought in 07-08). Prices have ofcourse stabilized right now but there are still a few houses which are selling at the same price as they were in 08 (even after spending $$$ on home improvements)

I know that cities are not going anywhere and work from home has been talked about since the advent of the internet but we've never had an experiment of this scale before. A majority of the population was forced to work from home which provided a lot of data to employers (cost of real estate vs productivity).

EDIT - back to the original question, will young families (primary occupants of townhouse/single family) continue to live in the city if they didnt have to commute to work everyday

Earlier to attract top talent and perhaps for branding, you'd have an office in the loop (closer to oglevile or union) but now you can chose to let go off that space and have a talent pool across the country. These thngs were always discussed but now companies are forced to think about them","just a counter point but I suspect in the future you might still need to go to the office two times a week (hybrid model as they say). Commuting from Naperville two times a week is a lot better than 5. Chicago still has the best jobs in the midwest area, so saying that you'd rather bounce from IL unless you live in a city seems aggressive. Thoughts?","Yep! Agreed, cities arent going anywhere but what I meant was, will your property value be slashed in half in say the next 5 years?","I would think about Single family/townhouses and the areas that I would be looking at is West Town, Boystown and Ukranian Village","Great article! Thanks for sharing. I know this is a poor example but I think about Detroit. Ever since the auto manufacturing crashed, the city never recovered. I know that automotive industry is very specific but this is also a pandemic. I agree that since 80's we've heard about the death of the office but these few years we've seen a massive advancement in technology (cheaper hardware + cheaper internet + truly high quality collaboration tools like Zoom). Also there has never been a time where a major part of the population has been forced to work from home. Earlier you heard about one or two companies but we've never truly had an experiment like this before.","Hello Chicago fam! I wanted to start a discussion if buying a house in the city right now would be considered a good decision.

One of the main benefits of living in the city was shorter commute but given that WFH is going to be accepted a lot more, will the city's real estate hold the same charm?","Hello PF fam! I wanted to start a discussion whether buying a house in the city right now would be considered a good decision.

I know PF does not consider buying a house as an investment as a prudent idea but lets say if you really liked a house, you will need to pay a premium compared to getting a house in the suburb. However, what is the future of cities going to look like with companies now realizing that they can save a lot on real estate if their employees can work from home as effectively, retail companies (with the exception of TJ Maxx) now putting solid infrastructure in place for online shopping and reducing its footprint on brick and mortar. So will real estate in the cities just depreciate?

Part of the city charm was 1) Short commute to work 2) Being close to bars and restaurants 3) Access to shopping/coffee/restaurants with a few footsteps

Success of 2) and 3) heavily relies on the fact that cities are more populous than suburbs but is that going to hold true for the near future (5-10 years?)",Spy Game,I see - thanks so much for your input.,"Nope, carfax says Branded Title: Buyback or Lemon","Carfax has listed it as ""Branded Title: Buyback or Lemon""","This is what was stated in the carfax

""Vehicle reacquired by the manufacturer pursuant to applicable state consumer warranty laws or to promote customer satisfaction""",Can you share a little bit about not having the same protections ? What do you mean by that?,"Some states like California and New York have lemon laws that heavily side with the consumer (that’s a good thing) but I think in this case, it was a lease buyback, so I’m guessing that the dealer didn’t have that much to lose perhaps? Maybe they convinced the customer to just get a new vehicle?",From what I was reading that sometimes it’s a software issue from the manufacturer and the dealer just can’t fix it. The issue is usually fixed by engineers as a patch.,"Hello all! I am in the market for a Mercedes GLE and there is a MB dealer selling one nearby (~40 miles away). Its fairly new, 2020 and only 10k miles. The only catch is that its a lemon buyback. I was talking to the sales rep over the phone and he was saying it was a software issue not showing the speed limit assistance but he needs to confirm it. It seems like he wants to me to come and then let me know about the issue. He kept harping on the fact that MB would never put it back in the market unless they've thoroughly inspected it (I think thats fair but why would you not tell the exact issue?)

There is factory warranty on it till 12/2023 but if I wanted to buy extended warranty it would be through third party.

What can I do to make sure I am not opening a can of worms here? Ideally I would not go for this car but I have some specific requirements which seems to not be that common (3rd row, heated steering wheel).

Finally I was hoping to get some advice on the price.

Question regarding ownership. I am mentally ready to pay the extra cost that come with owning a luxury car (premium fuel, higher insurance etc) but I am a little nervous about long term ownership to a point where it becomes a liability. I've had my camry for 7 years and this year has been the most expensive of all (spent 2.5k already on all the regular upkeep like coolant fluid, water pump etc etc), not that I mind it because I intend on driving it to the ground. 

If I go for the Mercedes, I intend on buying it and keeping it for at least 7-8 years. Is that even possible without constantly pouring  money on it?

I expect to drive less than 10k miles a year and plan on sticking to the maintenance plan/schedule as suggested. Is there still a high chance of unexpected costs?

A little background about myself. Never owned a luxury car in my life. I feel like I can finally afford one and absolutely love the Mercedes. I think it blows the competition out of the water. The two cars I am considering are GLE 3rd row or the GLS

Question regarding ownership. I am mentally ready to pay the extra cost that come with owning a luxury car (premium fuel, higher insurance etc) but I am a little nervous about long term ownership to a point where it becomes a liability. I've had my camry for 7 years and this year has been the most expensive of all (spent 2.5k already on all the regular upkeep like coolant fluid, water pump etc etc), not that I mind it because I intend on driving it to the ground. 

If I go for the Mercedes, I intend on buying it and keeping it for at least 7-8 years. Is that even possible without constantly pouring  money on it?

I expect to drive less than 10k miles a year and plan on sticking to the maintenance plan/schedule as suggested. Is there still a high chance of unexpected costs?

A little background about myself. Never owned a luxury car in my life. I feel like I can finally afford one and absolutely love the Mercedes. I think it blows the competition out of the water. The two cars I am considering are GLE 3rd row or the GLS

Question regarding ownership. I am mentally ready to pay the extra cost that come with owning a luxury car (premium fuel, higher insurance etc) but I am a little nervous about long term ownership to a point where it becomes a liability. I've had my camry for 7 years and this year has been the most expensive of all (spent 2.5k already on all the regular upkeep like coolant fluid, water pump etc etc), not that I mind it because I intend on driving it to the ground. 

If I go for the Mercedes, I intend on buying it and keeping it for at least 7-8 years. Is that even possible without constantly pouring  money on it?

I expect to drive less than 10k miles a year and plan on sticking to the maintenance plan/schedule as suggested. Is there still a high chance of unexpected costs?

A little background about myself. Never owned a luxury car in my life. I feel like I can finally afford one and absolutely love the Mercedes. I think it blows the competition out of the water. The two cars I am considering are GLE 3rd row or the GLS

Question regarding ownership. I am mentally ready to pay the extra cost that come with owning a luxury car (premium fuel, higher insurance etc) but I am a little nervous about long term ownership to a point where it becomes a liability. I've had my camry for 7 years and this year has been the most expensive of all (spent 2.5k already on all the regular upkeep like coolant fluid, water pump etc etc), not that I mind it because I intend on driving it to the ground. 

If I go for the Mercedes, I intend on buying it and keeping it for at least 7-8 years. Is that even possible without constantly pouring  money on it?

I expect to drive less than 10k miles a year and plan on sticking to the maintenance plan/schedule as suggested. Is there still a high chance of unexpected costs?

A little background about myself. Never owned a luxury car in my life. I feel like I can finally afford one and absolutely love the Mercedes. I think it blows the competition out of the water. The two cars I am considering are GLE 3rd row or the GLS

Question regarding ownership. I am mentally ready to pay the extra cost that come with owning a luxury car (premium fuel, higher insurance etc) but I am a little nervous about long term ownership to a point where it becomes a liability. I've had my camry for 7 years and this year has been the most expensive of all (spent 2.5k already on all the regular upkeep like coolant fluid, water pump etc etc), not that I mind it because I intend on driving it to the ground. 

If I go for the Mercedes, I intend on buying it and keeping it for at least 7-8 years. Is that even possible without constantly pouring  money on it?

I expect to drive less than 10k miles a year and plan on sticking to the maintenance plan/schedule as suggested. Is there still a high chance of unexpected costs?

A little background about myself. Never owned a luxury car in my life. I feel like I can finally afford one and absolutely love the Mercedes. I think it blows the competition out of the water. The two cars I am considering are GLE 3rd row or the GLS

Question regarding ownership. I am mentally ready to pay the extra cost that come with owning a luxury car (premium fuel, higher insurance etc) but I am a little nervous about long term ownership to a point where it becomes a liability. I've had my camry for 7 years and this year has been the most expensive of all (spent 2.5k already on all the regular upkeep like coolant fluid, water pump etc etc), not that I mind it because I intend on driving it to the ground. 

If I go for the Mercedes, I intend on buying it and keeping it for at least 7-8 years. Is that even possible without constantly pouring  money on it?

I expect to drive less than 10k miles a year and plan on sticking to the maintenance plan/schedule as suggested. Is there still a high chance of unexpected costs?

A little background about myself. Never owned a luxury car in my life. I feel like I can finally afford one and absolutely love the Mercedes. I think it blows the competition out of the water. The two cars I am considering are GLE 3rd row or the GLS

Question regarding ownership. I am mentally ready to pay the extra cost that come with owning a luxury car (premium fuel, higher insurance etc) but I am a little nervous about long term ownership to a point where it becomes a liability. I've had my camry for 7 years and this year has been the most expensive of all (spent 2.5k already on all the regular upkeep like coolant fluid, water pump etc etc), not that I mind it because I intend on driving it to the ground. 

If I go for the Mercedes, I intend on buying it and keeping it for at least 7-8 years. Is that even possible without constantly pouring  money on it?

I expect to drive less than 10k miles a year and plan on sticking to the maintenance plan/schedule as suggested. Is there still a high chance of unexpected costs?

A little background about myself. Never owned a luxury car in my life. I feel like I can finally afford one and absolutely love the Mercedes. I think it blows the competition out of the water. The two cars I am considering are GLE 3rd row or the GLS

Question regarding ownership. I am mentally ready to pay the extra cost that come with owning a luxury car (premium fuel, higher insurance etc) but I am a little nervous about long term ownership to a point where it becomes a liability. I've had my camry for 7 years and this year has been the most expensive of all (spent 2.5k already on all the regular upkeep like coolant fluid, water pump etc etc), not that I mind it because I intend on driving it to the ground. 

If I go for the Mercedes, I intend on buying it and keeping it for at least 7-8 years. Is that even possible without constantly pouring  money on it?

I expect to drive less than 10k miles a year and plan on sticking to the maintenance plan/schedule as suggested. Is there still a high chance of unexpected costs?

Thanks a lot for reading.","I personally feel that the glory days of movie theaters are over. Movie theaters had a few things going for them, 

* Great equipment that made movie watching fun, screens, dolby sound etc. With hardware being cheaper by the day, its only a matter of time that consumers will catch up. Besides, you dont need the best sound to watch something like 80% of movies being made. 
*  Exclusivity - Theaters and distributors had an agreement that movies could not come on DVD or streaming for a minimum of 75 days. It was this lack of access that made theaters very attractive. Not to mention that people wanted to watch the latest avengers or star wars because they didnt want to be affected by spoilers being posted from dickheads on social media. But now, that [75 days is reduced to 11 days](https://snacks.robinhood.com/newsletters/6RFtJk3mnCKOO7aaL4NeV/articles/5k77brddXY731lGleLUGG4/), I think its reasonable time for someone to pass on movie theaters and watching it at home
* Experience - Date nights, watching movie with friends etc. This I believe is something that cannot be replaced/recreated but its also not a big enough market for theaters to sustain for. 
* Big event movies - Star wars, Avengers, DC etc which are CGI heavy movies are not as fun to watch at home as the theaters but as Petty Jenkins mentioned, studios will just adapt. Movie makers are creative people and they will focus on the content on something that is more suitable for home viewing. 
* Studio/Theater relationship - It was almost considered impossible for a movie to gross over 500M worldwide without the support of the theaters but Disney showed with Trolls 2 that its most certainly possible and if studios can find the right distribution channel, they too can achieve it. 
* 1 billion revenue - Lets say Wonder Woman drops tomorrow on streaming for $19.99. If 25 million people buy it, the movie has made 500 million already. I know 25 million in the US seems really high that can afford it but if you add Canada, UK, Western Europe, Australia, NZ and Japan, its achievable. And if you reduce to price to $9.99 in countries like China, India, you can easily have the 25 million in those markets alone resulting in your gross revenue as 750 million and I have to no doubt that if the movie is good, it will make up the rest of 250 million when it makes deals with Amazon Prime/Netflix. 

I think that studios are weary of dropping WW84, No time to Die on streaming yet because its very very difficult to predict the revenue or the loss of it due to piracy. But with Youtube Music, Apple Music and Spotify I think the music industry has almost fixed the piracy issue to the point where its just a cost of doing business instead of an actual hurdle","Sorry - poor choice of words, I meant change of status, ie H1 to H4","In a similar boat as you but making a blanket statement of US' hatred of immigrants is misplaced. If you wouldve been born in any country other than India, you wouldve had a US passport for now. 

Unfortunately the law made in the early 2000's for allocating green card has been around 7% for each country and that is the main cause. Any substantial progress on changing that law has been met with severe backlash not only from America but other country representatives (immigration groups) as well because so far this has not affected them as much. 

AILA has benefited the most from Indians stuck in green card backlog. Like you mentioned, every change of employer, every green card application generates tens of thousands of dollars of revenue for attorneys (applicant + family)",Would you know what the plans are for allowing it for adjustment of status?
hasmukh_lal_ji,"hello guys, my name is Saksham , i am from India, i want to share my feeling because i have nobody to tell what i am feeling . and sorry for my bad english.

this year i passed class 12

8 months ago , lockdown started, i was happy that no social interaction, just at home, i will be what i want. time passed , in just one month lost all contact with fake friends , just one best friend , and girl (and used to like her) . slowly slowly i felt alone but then i used to talk to my best friend every day, and also chat with the girl for 1 hr average. and the time i spent with the girl are the most favorite in my whole day  

after 2 month of this still pandemic shit is going on. but i become more frank to the girl (like share my life stories, used to flirt with her ironically and she liked that) one day i asked her for date. she denied and also she was soo angry that that day our friendship also ruined . i got sad, my heart got broke . i want to cry, but because i am home, my parents wont like it. when my parents were sleeping , i cry that time and as low as possible

i am lucky enough that i have friend to discuss, but just on call.

now i feel very very alone

as i mentioned that this year i passed class 12. and to crack JEE exam i decided to take a drop(which is normal here) and i joined a coaching institute (around 7 month ago) . that time academic load was very low. but now as time passes , they have increase their pace, and i was not able to digest they taught. as a result , my marks are decreasing, and so my confidence . seeing my classmates going to collage and me still preparing for entrance exam makes me more depressed

and so much time is wasted in coaching and stuff that i am not able to do what i am interested in and i have this constant fear that suppressing my interest would make me lose my interest on what i want

i am at the stage where i am depress, stressed, full of regret, and fear 

i dont what should i do","i would have answered the same, but nobody had ever asked me (⌣̩̩́\_⌣̩̩̀)",hope i can express myself with IRL people,Get well soon bruh,"Tru bro, 1 month pehele hi choda hai , life itni positive ho gayi hai .",gas chamber for jew's kid,is he wearing batman suit in 2nd picture ?,You have my upvote,girlfriend get to know that she is adopted,"twitter : new day , new boycott",i want to know who is she,cant even imagine,she pulls out her dick,i dont have siblings (ಥ﹏ಥ),"Ngl , Bharti se expect nahi kiya tha",Itna toh mere jeb me rehta hai,"ok

so i did nothing you say  
and yes, i am stupid , i thought that we are close enough to take our friendship to relationship , but end up ruining friendship as well   
good thing i have overcome the pain, and learned a lot   
i also want to add that she didn't knew she i called her for date, i want to give her surprise , i called her home, i cooked food for her, and the plan was that we will have lunch together and i will propose her   
but things didnt went well","yeh, thanks for correcting me",I feel shame that I am only able give an upvote,Body organs got sold on dark web,"but yaar saiman surprise bahut acha deta hai, saiman is the real OG of youtube"
fairisleknitting,"Like I said, my mom died last week, and I just am having a really hard time coming to grips with the reality of it. Especially because I am an atheist and I've gotten so many suggestions to just talk to my mom because she is listening from heaven that really hurt, but I can't really tell family members that it hurts. Me and my husband don't tell others we are atheists because of obvious reasons. Also, even though my mom has been sick for 2 years with cancer and other health problems and just can't shake feeling relieved and feeling sad at the same time. 

Right before my mom got sick 2 years ago I was hospitalized for suicidal depression and her illness made it incredibly difficult for me to recover. Now that she has passed I find myself back sliding with my thoughts. I'm sleeping too much and I can't fall asleep. I have anxiety attacks when I do chores that remind me of my mom. And I cry every time I see her photos I've put up around the house. I can't bear to take them down either. 

I don't know what to do to feel better and everyone is telling me it's okay to feel like this, but it just feels unbearable. I can barely take care of myself. 

I'm posting here because I just feel so sad and lost and the pain is just getting to an unbearable level.

1. Time does heal.

2. I learnt I was a bit selfish with everyone in my life and I've become more compassionate. 

3. I've accepted who I am. People will have a opinion of me regardless. I'm building up my confidence slowly but surely. 

4. I've learnt I'm the only person responsible for my happiness. 

5. I'm figuring out that everyone has their own issues and the world doesnt revolve around me.

6. Relationships aren't everything.  I'll be fine with or without a relationship. 

7. I've learnt that I cant fix anyone's problems but my own. 

8. I'm starting to learn to value myself.

9. I've learnt self respect and communicating better.

10. No one is perfect not my ex not anyone. 

had a dream last night about my ex. I had a dream I unblocked her and she sent me a voice message. It really made me think that I should message her and talk to her. She used to be my bestfriend but I cant fix or force her to be in my life. I still have alot of feelings for her. But it's all about how you handle it.  I can't change how people perceive me. I have self respect and I wont beg anyone ever again.

As much as I want to message her again I'm not putting myself through that again.",I had a dream I unblocked her and she sent me a voice message me. I felt so weird and it brought somuch feelings back. It made me wanna contact her and talk to her . It's been a couple months of no contact . And this dream definitely got to me. Made me wonder if I should break no contact or not.,"I never in a million years thought I'd block you and go on no contact. Its probably been one of the toughest decisions ever. I just felt like I never had control when it came to you. You always knew how to manipulate and make everything good and make everything seem fine. We went through alot over the couple years we've been together. I had to do no contact before I didnt even know who i am anymore.  You kept pulling me back in it was a never ending cycle of me just ending up hurt. So i decided it's best for me cut the ties. Not because I dont love but because loving you hurts. Loving you makes me anxious and cripples me in ways you wouldn't understand. I always feel uneasy with you because your actions are unpredictable and you never seem to show your true intentions and I I got tired of doing all the work.i did way too much for you. I did more for you than I did for myself and I didn't even get most of the effort I put in reciprocated. I thought us getting back together would fix everything but I noticed alot. You had problems committing to anything long term which made sense to alot of your actions and plans. I always thought it was strange you made plans for the future for us but never made us a priority.  Its almost like I was sold a dream that will never exist. I wasn't perfect either I made some mistakes but I learnt from them the second time around  I thought you changed too but you just became someone I didnt even know. I started seeing you as what you were with out the rose colored glasses and I hated it. The person you become wasnt the girl who I feel Inlove with. So I knew you I couldnt stay. I had to create distance between us. Cause you always had me in your back pocket and had me under your control. So I knew it was time to leave. So I waited for you to give up like I knew you would cause you have problems with commitment. I cant fix your problems I never should Have tried I regret it. I was the type of person who always tried to fix things I was a bad person back then I was toxic and you brought out a bad side of me too. We both weren't perfect we had issues . I thought we could fix it but some things cant be fixed we dont see the world the same. You were very selfish in our relationship and I I was very insecure and so were you. I'll always love you ,you'll always have a place in my heart but I've learnt alot in these couple months since we broke up for the second time. I deserve a different kind of love the kind of love you dont comprehend. We just aren't compatible and I was trying to force us to be together. I fixed every situation and it's a habit I've worked on and I'm gladly stepping into my power as a person and seeing the world in a new light.


 Maybe I'll see you again Maybe I won't but whatever happens life always has a way of throwing you a curve ball and hang in there guys It does get better but its alot of up and down. I've dug deep and done alot of reflection that has helped me tremendously. I think the breakup has helped me in some ways and no contact has helped me see what is important. It really lets be alone with your thoughts and give yourself time to just be by yourself and force yourself to reflect. I'm still on my journey but I'm definitely growing as a person day by day",It takes alot of reflection and digging deep you will get there mate,"I wanted to feel bad for going on no contact. But then I remembered all the shit I did for you and had to put up with. All the times you made me feel like shit.all the lies you told me and all the things I did for you. I gave you everything I have no regrets. I know that I tried my best when it came to you. I'm just done trying that's it. You took me for granted and its time I start being selfish with my time and with who I am and be happy and move on. I forgive you for hurting me and for everything but I can ever allow for myself to be treated like that ever again.

I know things I'll get better I now know my value.",I'll definitely do some research thank you I appreciate it,She got raped in March or Feb I dont remember the exact date but after it happened I was there for her and did research on what shes going through.  And I was there for her. And a few months later she started to forget about are relationship and kind of felt she was angry at me when I didn't do anything sometimes. She just started to distance herself and then we broke up,We broke up it's been a few months since then and I'm going on contact.  But I feel so bad for not reaching out. I think what happened to her was the partially the cause for us breaking up. I feel bad for not reaching out am I a bad person for it ? . It's like the second time we broke up both of the times she broke up with me. I feel bad for going on contact since what happened to her. Am I bad person for it?,"I knew I wanted to spend each and every moment with you. But it didn't go how I thought it would.  You didn't reciprocate my feelings.  Looking back on all the bad stuff you did I wish I left sooner. I definitely put your feelings over mine. I regret always trying to fix your issues and forgetting about me. I was there for you when no one was.  I listened to you I loved you and I cared for you.  Yet you still gave up on me. I would never do that to you. I feel so stupid for expecting us to work out even tho we were never the same.

You always made me secondary to everything else in your life. I dont regret us being together I just regret not loving myself enough to see that you aren't meant for me and that's okay. I forgive you for hurting me. I forgive myself for not knowing better at the time.i know now that I'm the most important person in my life and no one else. You taught me alot about myself even if you dont know it. I never felt enough for you cause I never felt good enough for myself but now I feel much much better about myself and see that I'm worthy of love and I'm not ashamed of who I am. I hope you find happiness if it isn't with me. I think its time I let go of the thought of us getting back together again. It's just not something that's gonna help me grow. I'm saying goodbye to the past but I'll never forget the person you were to me. You were so special to me. Letting go of you is hardest think I've had to do but it's part of life. Maybe one day we'll cross paths again.",I know shes bad for me but why do I care so much and want to know how shes doing. I just want to get it out of my head,Always down to try new games I play different kinds depends on my mood,I suddenly feel like lm inadequate to be in another relationship with anyone . I feel insecure about my body and everything and I hate feeling this way.  I was never feeling this way before.  But I'm trying to work through my insecurities and be okay with who I am but its not easy. Sometimes i think she left me because i wasn't enough for her. And I just wasnt doing enough and my body wasn't enough.  I wish I didnt feel this way and I didn't feel so insecure in my body and sometimes doubt that I'll ever make someone happy.  I just want to be able to feel good about myself again. I just want to let go of the insecurities I've been feeling,So I went through a break up with a girl I've been seeing for a couple years. Our relationship was toxic and everything I always felt like I didn't matter. Now that I'm out of our relationship I keep doubting myself and feeling like crap about myself and feeling like I'm just not enough for anyone.i really want to feel good about myself again it's been a couple months of no contact but I still feel inadequate do you guys have any advice? Everytime I just dose off and think about the past and I hate the feeling,So I went through a break up with a girl I've been seeing for a couple years.

It sucks that I feel so inadequate like damn,Finding out just now my mom talked to her a couple months after we broke up makes me so mad. Then she just acts like she didnt hurt me so bad and that we good. It makes me so fucking mad that shes acting like nothing happened I feel so pissed and sad shit man. It definitely makes me feel some type of way for sure she can be so nonchalant like she didnt hurt me and all that. And it sucks so much today has been a draining now and now finding this out makes me feel worse.,We kind of ended on bad terms . And I'm still trying my hardest not to blame myself,My ex went through a rape and I supported her decision to not tell her parents or anything. But I'm some what still a bit traumatized and I think about how horrible she must've felt and a part of me feels like it's somewhat my fault and I feel so bad about it.i want to make peace about what happened but its been hard . Me and her dont talk anymore we used to be close. Sometimes I think about what happened to her and just feel so dead inside,My ex was raped and I still feel sort of traumatized by it and I sort of blame myself for it. I followed her wishes and supported her by why does it haunt me?,This hit home my ex was also very controlling and emotionally abuse in some parts of the relationship,I'll definitely have to check it they offer that
arrowmissedtheapple,"I am having what I would refer to as a flareup. My husband, who doesn't believe in medication for this, I feel is unsupportive. He ignores it or doesn't see it. After 7 years together I can't figure out how. The tension between us because of it is growing to be a problem. I came to him wanting support because I want to raise my dosage and he said no. Like I was asking him. After all this time he should know I wouldnt ask him because if it was up to him I wouldnt be on anything. He threatened to throw my antidepressants away after I went back on them. I was off because we were trying to get pregnant. After the baby breastfeeding didn't work for me so I decided it was safe to return to them. I was in full blown postpartum, starting to hallucinate and he dared to try to throw them away. I keep going back to that memory. I know this is not written well and is probably rambling but I can't talk to this to anyone. I know I should be seeing a psychiatrist but there's no money for that at the moment. So I'm left with my thoughts.

 I know my mom had to get one done. I can't remember how much she said it cost her, including dr office visit. Just that she was complaining about price. My sister has insurance through the state, pays less and gets more costs covered than my parents insurance. Something she wants to look into but honestly doesn't know where to start. She's not mad at my sister just that insurance costs so much but is not really covering anything until a high deductible is reached. 

Still she wouldn't fake a test. She came in contact with someone that tested positive. Since she baby sits my nephew she got the test done.","I didn't.

I wasn't told that my Uncle and Aunt had killed someone until years after my uncles death. He died when I was 8. Few years before I was born he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia (he was around 40 I believe). Though when the murder happened he wasn't schizophrenic. The mental illness likely caused by years of drug abuse.

I was told their apartment was robbed. Some how or another they came across the individual(s?). I guess they were selling their possessions. I am assuming my Uncle is the one that actually killed the person. They threw the gun in the Detroit river and drove to my grandmother's house. My mother said they were both nervous and freaking out.

Never came off as someone capable of murder. Though I wasn't aware that he was schizophrenic either. My mom was picking him up from the police station a lot.

My mom knew a serial killer. Eugene something, they called him slice n dice, though I'm pretty sure that was never to his face. She said he was a sociopath. Witnessing the crimes was more of a shock then knowing he was capable. She never saw it but my Uncle (not the one mentioned above) witnessed him killing a man and then lighting him on fire. Idk what his motives were for killing. He was sent away when he brutally killed a young pregnant woman. Few years ago an acquaintance ran into him, so he's out.",They are not yours,I looked up their size.

She got out asked him if he was okay he said yeah, got back on and left. Idk if she gave him her info or if he just took her plate. He filed a report. She went down gave her story. He changed his story, claimed she hit him. her insurance paid without even trying to fight. She found out when she tried to switch insurance providers and they wouldn't insure her. I have no idea what she did to get them to challenge this but I remember her going to court a few times to fight this. By the end his story completely fell apart. I felt so bad for my mom because she was horribly stressed from the whole thing. Lucky for her she had a passenger that was able and willing to show up to court. That and his character witness failed to show up to court. Always call the police if you have to share information and invest in a dash cam.","Sleep. My son wake me up every 2 to 3 hrs.

either a belvita or two packets of oatmeal
and a piece of fruit whether it be a banana or a packet of berries
sometimes a granola thats sugary so I try and stay away 

Lunch will be my biggest meal being whatever I can get my hands on at school or whats on my shelves including pastas

Dinner most of the time:
a boneless/skinless chicken breast 
a starch such as rice or potatoes
and a veggie

They all just scatter off and they’ll pair up for jobs whilst I’m left to do them by myself. It just makes me feel so bad about myself like maybe I’m too boring, I’m too tomboy-ish, I have nothing going in my life. I feel like I’m going crazy I can’t take it anymore I just can’t please help help help I can’t take it, I feel like i could just burst.",Congrats! That’s great you’re walking again!

Throughout the years I’ve always had acquaintances, I’ve made good relationships with people through work or college (or so i thought) yet people don’t stay in contact with me.

At first I thought it was mainly play aggression as he grabs my arms, bites down and bobs them with his feet but he’s starting to do it more regular. He attacks my legs when I go up the stairs, when I go to pet him he tends to bite my hands. The final straw was when I was sat in bed, I took no notice of him and he bit down hard on my arm and scratched me the worst he has ever done. I’m so upset because I knew this was a loving breed and he was so lovely, he never does this to partner and yet I spoil him with toys, feed him etc. I have tried shouting no but it makes him worse, I’ve tried giving him a toy to distract as well.","I have the top forward part of my ear pierced and I’ve had it for nearly a year. It was okay to begin with but now the top part of my ear is swollen and it won’t go down! I’m scared my ear is going to stay that way.

It is still swollen, a little red and there’s is crusting and dryness where the ball is. I’d love to take it out but they said it could trap the infection inside. I don’t know what else to do. I wish I had never had it pierced.","Omg yes, I relate to you so much it’s like we’re twins! ","I have thin mid length hair, it’s particularly worse at the top as you can see my scalp.

My hair has become more frizzier and horrible. I straighten my hair 1-2 a week, I don’t use any hair styling products. I use my hairdryer on mid setting. I’m starting to take 10,000mg of biotin to see if I can fix my thin scalp. I have done a coconut oil and castor oil mask once a week. Should I use dry shampoo and is there any other thing I could do?

Thanks I’ll try that 

","I left but I remember how bad it used to make me, I used to feel sick in my car before I started. I couldn’t eat, my stomach aches to no end. The people there were really toxic and part of that worry. Luckily I finished but I still keep dreaming and waking up with bad anxiety about that place, I keep feeling shaky. I can’t stop worrying constantly, thinking ‘I wonder if they think this about me’ and ‘I wonder if they’re gossiping about me’ It doesn’t help that I do occasionally come across the most toxic person from that place who hates me with a passion.

Mean-Journalist,"I don't know how else to describe it, but it seems like I go from doing okay-ish at best to feeling like I want to be erased from existence. There's not really an in-between. It mostly hits me when I'm done with work or the weekend starts. Immediately this feeling of just despising everything that I could do with my free time, despising myself cuts through any plans or ambitions I had and lingers there for hours on end. 

It feels impossible to climb out if this hellhole and in the moment I feel this existential dread. I genuinely cannot fathom why I would even want to live anymore. Everything seems so pointless, dreary and boring. All of my interests don't do anything for me anymore, I just want to hide away from everyone cause I'm so ashamed of the way I feel and of neglecting chores around my house and ugh... It's just so frustrating, this feeling is kind of always there in the background, but it just feels like it gets wildly intense for bursts of time. 

I've been struggling with this for around twelve years now, therapy has made it manageable but the last year and a half or so everything's jus been getting worse and worse.

**Pasta popeye**

* 750gr spinazie a la creme (iglo voor beste resultaat)
* Pakje boursin
* 300gr gehakt (half om half)
* 200gr champignons
* 50gr cashewnoten
* teentje knoflook
* kwart ui, fijngesneden

&#x200B;

**Stappen**

1. Zorg dat de spinazie ontdooid is
2. Doe een beetje olijfolie in een grote non-stick pan 
3. Laat de pan op temperatuur komen, met het vuur op mid/hoog
4. Fruit de uitjes tot ze licht doorzichtig zijn, voeg dan de knoflook toe en bak deze beiden nog een minuutje door
5. Voeg de champignons toe en bak deze mee voor zo'n twee minuten
6. Voeg de gehakt toe, rul het gehakt tot er wat karamelisatie plaatsvindt
7. Doe alle spinazie in de pan, zorg ervoor dat je eventuele aanbaksels van de bodem afschraapt zodat deze in de saus terechtkomt
8. Kook wat pasta (fussili/spaghetti is hier erg lekker bij)
9. Voeg de boursin (het hele pakje) toe aan de pan, roer dit door de spinazie/gehakt heen en zet het vuur op mid/laag
10. Als laatste voeg je de cashewnoten toe en laat je de saus licht sudderen tot de pasta klaar is
11. Bij het serveren kan je nog wat parmezaanse kaas eroverheen doen","Zelf ben ik al tijden zoekende en heb ik de zoektocht opgegeven. De harde realiteit die een andere gebruiker hier al heeft genoemd lijkt mij bij ook waar te zijn. Ik heb geen passie voor m'n werk, en buiten m'n werktijden spendeer ik er ook geen tot weinig aandacht aan. Hier heb ik eerlijkgezegd ook nooit behoefte aan gehad, maar omdat het in mijn vakgebied vrijwel verwacht wordt dat je buiten werktijd er tijd aan spendeert voelde ik de druk om dat ook te doen.  


Aan die druk geef ik in ieder geval niet meer toe, m'n werk is m'n werk en na 5 uur ben ik er klaar mee. Ik zie het enkel als een manier om m'n daadwerkelijke hobbies te bekostigen, en ik ben er een stuk gelukkiger door geworden. :)",Do you post your art online anywhere?

defendaopoppunk,"TL;DR: after almost 10 years of being relatively emotionally stable I now find myself contemplating suicide again.

Hi there. So, first things first, I know 2020 is being hard on everyone and I know I’m in a very privileged position if compared to many others, but still it seems I can no longer find the means to keep fighting depression.

In October 2018 I moved to a foreign country/continent to study. What at first was supposed to be for one year only ended up being a long term decision. I got a job and decided to stay.

Two years later I find myself away from all my family and loved ones in the middle of a pandemic. I have now lost my job and I’m still in an irregular situation in the country where I reside, because they still haven’t accepted my residency request, which means I can’t go visit my family, friends and homeland.

I have been looking for jobs but of course this crisis makes everything harder, so nothing came up yet and I’m starting to feel desperate. I’m running out of money, I’m not even legal here, and even though I have friends here I feel like I don’t have anyone I can *fully* trust or who truly understands me.

I haven’t had suicidal thoughts since I was about 18 years old, but now (I’m currently 26) I see these thoughts coming closer and closer despite my efforts of pushing them away and keep trying.

I haven’t given up, I’m going to therapy, I’m doing some small freelance works and I keep looking for permanent jobs, but being a foreigner here doesn’t help (lots of xenophobia and prejudice towards my nationality).
But I feel like everyday I’m closer to finally giving up.

How do you cope with your depression relapses?",Your family is clearly toxic. I would keep a distance from them.,I think you should contact her to find out the truth and if she is actually pregnant then you should ask for a DNA test.,"I honestly think you’re overthinking! 
Give it a day or two... if she doesn’t message you I think it’s fine you message her. Wouldn’t worry if I were you.","I think it depends.

Do you know her in person? Do you have something in common you can bring up to initiate a conversation? If not, I would wait a couple of days if she doesn’t respond. ","Exactly, if you guys have known each other for that long and he willingly crossed the friends line then what is left to get to know? I think it’s kind of weird... of course he has all the right to want to relate to someone that way if that’s how he feels comfortable but the thing is: does it work FOR YOU?","I would say you’re overthinking this and the more you overthink the most likely it is for you to do or say things that could eventually “ruin” the situation.

My advice as a 24F who has been in similar situations is: chill out. Give the girl some space, wait for her to come initiate a conversation with you, don’t be too available all the time. ",There is no way I would commit to a serious relationship before having sex. Sex is a big part of it for me and I actually believe you can get to know a lot about someone by having sex and sharing intimacy with them - things that could make a big difference in a relationship.,"You’re not overreacting, he is being selfish. I have depression and anxiety and I know how it can affect our relationships but our mental disorders are not, or at least should not be, excuses to just get settled into an unhealthy relationship.


For what you’ve described he doesn’t seem to care much about your happiness and this is just not cool.
And as for this thing he does of only inviting you to do stuff in which he benefits in some way is so wrong!
Relationships are supposed to be built in reciprocity, of course, but not in that way that everything you suggest must automatically give you something in return.


You guys should be going out to have fun together and honestly I think it is completely nonsense of him to “invite” you to clean up his mess.
Of course there will be moments when you can help each other with tasks and run errands or go grocery shopping but you guys have been dating for only 6 months right? This shouldn’t be like that and I’m really sorry you’re going through this because you seem to be a really nice person.",The only way you have to know the truth is by putting everything on the table. Tell Ben you guys are together and talk to her about she going behind your back to tell him you guys hooked up.,"He could be, but even if he is don’t you think it’s kinda fucked up what she’s doing? Telling him you guys have slept together behind your back after you had agreed on not telling him just yet? It just seems to me she’s trying to create some intrigue between you both.","Her general behavior. First she hooks up with your friend and acts like they’re in some kind of relationship and later sends him a picture holding hands with someone else? That’s cruel. Second you guys agreed you wouldn’t say anything to Ben just yet and off she goes tell him you guys hooked up behind your back, without a warning, and when you text her to ask about it she tells him again? I mean, you obviously can’t trust her and this is certainly not how someone who supposedly likes you should act.",You need to talk to him and ask why he changed his behavior. It is not unusual to have weird phases like this in a relationship but you must also be prepared for the worst. When your SO stops demonstrating affection and even acts as if they were annoyed by these demonstrations it’s not generally a good sign.,She’s playing both of you. Get out of this situation before it gets worse.,"You’re right, I don’t get relationships in which you feel like you have to login on your partners fb account to block someone because you feel like it. I prefer relationships based on trust and mutual respect. But hey that’s just me.",I’m as stupid as you are emotionally mature. Bye.,Then why wasn’t he the one to block tho,I just find it weird that you feel like you have the right to decide who your boyfriend may or may not be friends with. It’s one thing to talk about it and explain if something makes you uncomfortable but it’s a whole new level to login into someone else’s FB account to block another person you have issues with.,wtf? No you absolutely have no right to block people on social networks accounts that are not your own. Stop this nonsense ,"I know it can be upsetting, but she does not owe anything to you. The only person you can and should hold accountable in this situation is your boyfriend since he is the one committed to you. If he doesn’t give any space for her to come in, then you are ok and you should not worry. If however he gives her space to make moves, then your issue should be with him rather than her.","That sounds awful, I’m really sorry you had to go through this.
I, personally, have never had any experience close to this. I do however know a person that is going through the exact same situation, only she is now 50 and has 2 kids with her ex-husband (who is also a compulsive liar).
The thing is you have a child which is a bond that will tie you two together forever.  However that doesn’t mean you’ll have to put up with him. 
First things first, he seems like a toxic person to be around... is he as bad as a father as he was as a husband? If yes, then fight for your kids guard. If not, I know he was awful, but your kid has the right to have a relationship with their father, but you don’t need to. 
You don’t need to give him anything more than that, you don’t need to be open and inviting, you have all the right to cut him off of your personal life.","Honestly you could’ve just not dated Kylie because she was the only one available at the time and you were into Rachel... you started this wrong and it would be really fucked up to date Kylie’s best friend after setting her hopes high just to tear them down after a while.
Plus you are all work colleagues so the wise thing to do would be not getting involved with either of them.

njck-no-fap,"I think *statistically*, depression is more common in women than in men, but I think this is just because men are less likely to report it or talk about it for the reasons you've mentioned. It's seen as unmasculine.

I have social anxiety. And I know this for a fact. I've done a lot of research. But I haven't told anyone about it except my best friend. And I felt vulnerable af when I did too. But he was great about listening and didn't make me feel bad about it. I think I've also been dealing with on and off depression as well. But my depression is something I won't talk to anyone about. I've only told a few friends one night because I was high and drunk. Otherwise no one would ever know

I just feel like our society gives more sympathy to women when it comes to mental health because it's deemed ""weak"" for a man to show sensitivity and vulnerability. You wanna hear another interesting statistic? Men are more likely to commit suicide than women. Seems kinda odd, considering that these studies like to claim mental illness is more likely to occur in women... almost as if we live in a society where men don't feel like they can seek help because of social stigma","Honestly couldn't tell you. I talked to my best friend about it a few days ago, he's a believer in online dating, and when I told him that I rather become good friends with someone before pursuing a relationship, he warned me that this could lead to the friendship being awkward if I'm rejected.

I guess there's some truth to it, but I don't think it has to be awkward. Just depends on the maturity of you and the other person I guess. You can either let something as petty as a rejection get between months or years of friendship, or you could not. But maybe I'm oversimplifying things here",This kinda gives me an idea... I think I'm gonna try recording myself asking self-reflecting questions such as the example you gave above and listen to it the next time I trip. I think it could be therapeutic. Currently suffer from social anxiety and been wonder if psychedelics might be a cure. Actually made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/jyz6t8/so_lets_talk_about_shrooms/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) about this today coincidentally enough. But I'm also new to shrooms and haven't actually messed with other psychedelics so insight is appreciated.,This... this so much... people don't get it...,"I'm just confused about the part with someone tricking you into thinking you've made a friend and then wanting to date you? I mean personally for me, if I'm not good friends with someone, I won't really want to date them. I'm not really into the whole ""oh wow, you're hot, let's flirt and act like we care about each other for a few days to see if everything will work out and then dive into a relationship if so."" Just seems... really artificial that way. I'll only ask a person out if I've developed feelings for them overtime, but during that time period it's possible we become really good friends. Idk, I guess I just don't see how a friend wanting to become more than friends is deceitful in any way is all","I wouldn't advise asking why after rejection tho. Kinda comes off as being in denial and defensive.

Also, the muscle for rejection is a nice analogy, but like all muscles, constant use makes it sore. And it's a soreness I'm tired of experiencing.

I don't mean to bring everyone down with my depressing outlook, but I think it's only fair that everyone sees both sides of it. I'm to the point to where just bareing with the loneliness is better than feeling the pain of rejection. The lie that you get used to it the more it happens is absolute bs in my situation. It hurts just the same everytime. So no, I won't be asking that girl out. Because letting her go is better than being rejected in my eyes.

Guys, whether you take OP's advice or not, just be careful. Mental health is real and needs to be looked after. Rejection after rejection can be detrimental. Please take care of yourselves and remember that happiness can be found while single. Don't go looking for a significant other to find happiness. Find happiness first, then take OP's advice and ask that girl out. That's my advice.","Yo that was actually smooth af tho lol. And also probably her trying to drop a fat hint on your ass, but hey, you picked up on it and had a fun time, so congrats!","So I have ADHD, but for whatever reason my mother never directly told me until I asked her about it recently, and I was (not to sound arrogant) one or the smarter students in my high school, so studies weren't really affected. But college, as I'm learning from my first semester, is fucking brutal. So I talked to my doctor about it and was able to get prescribed adderall.

10mg, 2 pills a day. It worked wonders. I was able to actually focus on homework and time seemed to move in slow motion while taking tests. It felt good to finally be on top of my shit for once and not scrabble to get everything turned in minutes before the submission box closes.

But as final exams approach and final projects pile on top, I've started upping my dose to 3 pills a day. The first time I did it was during a particularly busy and stressful week. My brother's wedding was coming up that weekend, I had a big project to get done, a major essay over two books I hadn't read, my math and chem professors assigned more homework than usually, it felt impossible... that week I took three pills almost every day.

Tonight I was especially concerned about getting everything done. I had a final project due at midnight and like 3 other assignments. But tonight, I didn't just settle for the 3 pills. I took my 2 normally prescribed 10mg pills in the morning and afternoon, and then I took one of my roommate's 30mg pills... 50mg in one day... more than twice of what I'm prescribed. I ended up finishing everything by 10:00. Hmm, I wonder why I got done so much quicker than I anticipated? I took this 30mg pill at 5:00, it's 11:30, my heart is still beating like crazy.

I didn't think much of it until I laughingly texted my friend about how my heart was beating out of my chest from taking just one of my roommates pills. But he started showing genuine concern. He said how it was basically meth and if I don't chill out I'll grow a dependency on them. Then I started doing my own research on the dangers of too much adderall and how similar it was to meth. Apparently it's said to be more addictive than meth itself.

I don't think I'm actually addicted to it yet, but I'm sure that's what every addict says before they come to terms with the fact that they're addicted... with finals so close by I'm worried about my performance dropping if I stop taking them. I definitely will try to not go over my prescribed dosage from here on out though. But it's just concerning and I guess I just needed to let my thoughts flow a bit and type this long ass post. I'm not looking for any kind of response or advice, though it's all welcomed. I just needed to get this out there and off my chest

Edit: holy shit... I actually forgot to eat dinner... because of adderall. All I've eaten today is yogurt for breakfast and pizza rolls for lunch. No wonder I feel so weak right now. And I'm not even hungry either. This is a legitimate concern...","For sure. That's why I wish there was more research put into it. Maybe there's a way to control these trips by pairing shroom with other substances or by some sort of mental preparation? Maybe there's a way to force a ""helpful"" trip that causes you to do some deep self reflection. But there's no way to tell right now because research and use of shrooms are illegal for no apparent reason other than old propaganda",Haven't read that one. Looks interesting. I'll have to check it out sometime,"Exactly. I don't think shrooms were ever really given a fair chance in the medical field. It's possible that they can have negative mental effects, but how can we really tell when research is so limited and constricted? I just wish they could be given a fair chance because who knows what kind of beneficial medication could come out of them. But at this point they have such a bad stigma around them because of political propaganda from 50 years ago that people will fight against their legalization simply because of the stigma alone. It's a shame really.","Alright, so let me preface this by saying I don't usually advocate for drugs as a cure to anything - especially illegal drugs - but I feel like shrooms are heavily misunderstood, and if scientists and doctors were able to conduct more research about them, I believe they could be a natural cure to depression and anxiety.

So a little bit of a history lesson. The only reason shrooms and research of shrooms became illegal is because the Nixon administration hated anti-war hippies. However, even in the 1970s, Nixon couldn't just attack a group of people directly. So instead, he attacked the culture and delegalize all kinds of drugs that hippies were associated with, like weed and shrooms. This effectively criminalized hippies, hence the bad stigma they have to this day.

However, I've done a little bit of research and, as it turns out, shrooms are relatively harmless. They can have psychological consequences if you have a really bad trip, but typically there are methods to avoiding going down such a path. And you'd have to be a rich bastard to take enough shrooms to actually overdose, making them effectively impossible to overdose on. There are very few reports of people on shrooms physically harming other people.

So how does any of this relate to anxiety? So the thing about shrooms, for anyone who doesn't know, is that it kinda detaches you from your sense of self and allows you to view yourself as who you really are without your ego or self-esteem getting in the way. This allows you to come to realizations about yourself that were never obvious to you before. It's effectively a very powerful therapeutic drug, because you essential become your own therapist. Rather than opening up to someone and having them interpret your thoughts and respond from their own perspective, you can open up to yourself and respond truthfully to yourself without your self-image getting in the way.

Some people have claimed that shrooms have helped them overcome their anxiety and depression, because while taking them, something finally clicked within themselves and made them realize just how insignificant other people's perception of you really is. It just feels like a shame that more research hasn't been done on shrooms just because of politics. It seems like there could be a lot of potential here to develop a therapeutic drug that literally helps to *cure* anxiety rather than suppress it, but we can't because a bunch of rich, war-hungry individuals who ran the country in the 1970s didn't like hippies. I'm not looking for a lecture on how bad drugs are. I want to have a genuine and open-minded discussion on what your thoughts are on developing a cure for anxiety and depression using psychedelics.",The fact that that name wasn't already taken is actually kinda hilarious.,"A *drunk* girl... totally different situation

""Just live life"" doesn't mean ignoring your basic human morals. The fact you think it's ok to take advantage of an intoxicated person is kinda disturbing and probably a product of pmo. We do nofap to become better humans and rise above our animalistic urges. You'll realize that soon enough",Heh heh,I don't know the theories or science behind it. I'm merely speaking from my own personal experiences,"My college roommate has a high body count but is also an absolute genius. His dad left him at a young age so he became the man of the house fairly quickly and had to learn complicated things at a young age. He still has sex frequently and is still one of the smartest people I know. So I wouldn't exactly relate sex with intelligence.

*That said*, he also has a lot of mental issues such as depression and anxiety, and often talks about how he craves and actual relationship and not just sex. I would argue that SR can increase your mentality for sure, but I don't think virginity has any connection with intelligence. The misconception that nerds don't get laid is merely just a stereotype. There are bad bitches who like bad dudes, and then there are nerdy girls who like nerdy guys.

Mind you, all of this is coming from a virgin. I'm not speaking for a biased perspective. And I like to believe I'm pretty smart myself. I am going to a relatively prestigious university for my state, after all (I hope that doesn't come off as arrogant, but I'm trying to prove a point). I just don't belive there's a connection.","**Trigger Warning**

So a lot of people on this sub are celibate, as others have mentioned, so this might not be the best place to seek advice. However, I believe the time you last will actually *increase* after maintaining long enough streaks. By long, I mean months. Which might be difficult for you in your wife if sex is a big part of your relationship.

That said, there are ways to get around it. If you aren't trying for pregnancy and are willing to sacrifice a little pleasure to last longer, you could look into buying thicker condoms. If you're more concerned about pleasuring her than yourself, you could experiment with foreplay or toys. If you and your wife are ok with going multiple ""rounds"", then you could also just accept that your first ""round"" is going to be a short one, but after you get hard again you should be able to last longer.

If you haven't talked to your wife about trying SR then I heavily advise that you do. You're bettering yourself and receiving benefits that both increase your mood and health. There's nothing to be embarrassed about and I'm sure, being your wife, she would be/is understanding.","No. Porn is dangerous because it alters your perspective of women and reduces them to mere sex objects. It's also emotionally exhausting, because you become attached to these pornstars who don't really love or care about you, and after you relapse, your brain suddenly realizes the reality of your situation, hence post-nut guilt.

Enjoying a sexy chat with your significant other isn't the same thing. You view her as some**one** you love, not some**thing** to fuck. And she also loves and cares about you. The situation is completely different",I seriously feel attacked rn holy shit. I didn't know this was so common lmao. I keep a bag of trailmix in my room so that I at least won't starve myself to death,"Dude, same situation. Relapsed after a 50 day streak and fell into a relapse binge. Haven't been able to get back on track since. Until very recently, I'm currently on day 9. So congrats dude, let's get back our long streaks together","I have no problem with people experiencing benefits from a placebo affect. Because bottom line, it's working, right? The placebo affect is a real and powerful thing. What i do have a problem with is the pseudoscience that's spread all over this sub *because* people fail to realize they're experiencing a placebo.

Yes, nofap has real benefits. I've had long enough streaks to experience them myself. But those benefits don't appear on day freakin 11. These false promises that nofap is going to make you a female magnet just because you didn't touch your dick for 2 weeks only does more harm than good. People join this sub believing these promises, only to not experience then and to conclude that this sub is a lie. This is why this sub is never taken seriously.

You're experiencing a placebo, cool, good for you. But quit spreading false information. Every newcomer does it. You didn't kiss that girl because nofap made you more confident. You kissed that girl because nofap made you *think* you were more confident. Learn the difference. Stop spreading false information.

People have gone a whole year of nofap and reported that they never witnessed an increase in female attention. So imagine if someone's goal for doing nofap was to experience the same situation as op, only to be disappointed after a year of struggle. People need to realize this isn't what nofap is about. And spreading misinformation is never going to do anyone any good.","Oh, the ones about people gaining ""magically female attraction super powers"" make me cringe the most. It's always the newcomers too with like not even a 2 week streak. They don't get it at all. That's not what nofap is about. And making false promises to people like that will only lead to disappointment and relapse. It's a growing sub, that's great, but with every newcomer brings a load of ignorance, and other ignorant newcomers upvote their ignorant posts, and then these posts get to hot and, wow, it's just irritating my guy. Sorry, went on a bit of a rant there","Dude, you're at 11 days, you're experiencing a placebo. Nothing wrong with that, but spreading rumors that nofap gives you some sort of magical female attraction powers is why so many people treat this sub like a joke. You might have a small testosterone boost, that's it, and it definitely wouldn't be anything significant. This isn't a journey you do for female attraction. I learned that the hard way. You will too.",When I relapsed after a 50 day streak (longest streak so far) I definitely noticed a harder erection than I last remembered from 50 days ago,Already got the machine and it's done wonders so I'm not complaining. But I'm glad you managed to gain control over your hyperhidrosis.,"As someone who also suffers from social anxiety, I empathize with your situation. That said, first I would recommend you dissociate social anxiety with social skills, and really ask yourself if it's social skills you are lacking. Consider the fact that it's easier for you to communicate via text or writing than it is verbally. Is it really social skills you lack, or does your mind just go blank because of your social anxiety?

Social anxiety can come across as social awkwardness, but they are not the same thing. Inexperience in communicating with another person is not the same thing as your mind going blank because of subconscious trauma or whatever other reason you experience social anxiety. However, social anxiety can and often does lead to a lack of social experience, so it is definitely possible to be both socially unskilled and socially anxious.

Whatever your situation may be, my advice would be to first work on your social anxiety. Exposure therapy is a good approach. There are many tips and tricks you can find online for working on overcoming your social anxiety, and I would recommend you look into them as well as join the r/socialanxiety subreddit if you haven't already. Once you can hold a conversation with another person without your mind going blank and causing you to panic, it will be much easier to determine whether you really lack social skills or not, and it will also help you become more comfortable talking to people, which will help increase your social skills.

One easy therapeutic technique I've started incorporating into my life to help me overcome my social anxiety is locking eye contact with strangers. I lock eyes, and I don't break eye contact until they break it first. Obviously wouldn't recommend doing this with sketchy looking people on the side of the street, but looking at a stranger in the eyes and smiling until they break eye contact is a relatively low risk method for pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. But this is just one of many tactics for overcoming social anxiety. I recommend you look into and incorporate other methods into your daily life.","I've noticed this too. I try to understand why. For me, my porn addiction comes from loneliness. A lack of intimacy. So it's just hard for me to wrap my head around why people in relationships suffer so often from this. And I don't mean to trivialize those who are in relationships who suffer from porn addiction, but it's just not really something I personally can comprehend. I envy something that you already have, but yet you still come crawling back to porn. It's hard for us to see our own blessings, to realize what we already have, while others see it as clear as night and day. I guess addiction just does strange things to people","I've given up. I don't mean to sound depressing but I've been ghosted too many times that I've just come to terms with the fact that loneliness is better than feeling heartbroken. Rather not try than to get hurt. Sorry, this sounds really depressing, but it's just where I'm at right now",This is why I can't date. I get too attached to my dates too quickly. Only to be ghosted and feel heartbroken for days. Meanwhile they've moved on a long time ago. To them I'm just another date that didn't work out. The pain isn't something I want to deal with anymore.

I really struggled with this early on, because it seemed to me that I was trying really hard to perform femininity and it never felt right (although I believe that it was important to experiment and learn what felt good and what didn't). Something my (cisgender) wife pointed out to me (many many times) is that there is no real way to be feminine. She herself is not a particularly effeminate woman, but is still a woman and still connects to the world as a woman. She, like many women, also struggles with societal constructs of what it means to be a woman in society; i.e. body image, mannerisms. It has taken me a lot of time to think about how I relate and how I want to relate to these ideals that society has of women.

With that being said, I've spent a good amount of time studying feminism and gender and I feel like with out a solid grounding in feminism I would struggle more.

&#x200B;

As far as unlearning deep rooted and toxic masculinity, it is likely that you may be farther ahead than you think you are. A couple things to consider: Do you spend lots of time with cis-men? Are you expected to act a certain way around them? Maybe take a break from people who expect you to act a certain way.

When I first came out, I couldn't stand even being around (especially middle age) cis-men. I was terrified, I hated it, and I avoided it at all costs. I alienated myself because of this for a long time, out of internalized shame and transphobia. Once I mustered the courage to be me, and not give a fuck what they thought, I became more empowered and I didn't need their validation. 

Thinking about this now, I realized I was seeking validation from everyone, and cis-men were the least likely folks to give it. When I finally accepted myself, regardless of how I present in public, I was able to take that power back and most of the left over masculine mannerisms have faded away. I say most, because some of these are normal mannerisms and actually nongendered, such as confidence, self esteem, and autonomy, but these of course have been stolen from women to make women feel inferior. 

Anywho... that was a long one. Good luck friend!

&#x200B;

tl/dr: Find supportive people who won't judge you for experimenting, performing femininity sucks unless you want to do it, don't spend time with people who you have to perform masculinity for, learn to accept and love yourself, and read some good feminist literature. <3",They took over the Ace Hardware.

She would drive me to see a gender therapist a half hour away until I was eighteen. She gave me books on the subject. She recommended books for research. She must have been studying up on transgender issues and information years before I came out. She really tried to understand what I was going through...

But im the bad big sister who tried to kill herself 3 times and the bad sister who did drugs and moved in with her boyfriends and doesn't go to church and now I'm the bad sister ""attacking"" the church and ""name-calling"" it a cult.

I miss them. I love them. I don't want them to be in this. But they are. And there's nothing I can do. And now they don't love me. How do I deal with this?","I have legitimate questions.

- Why was Joseph Smith tarred and feathered?
- Why did Oliver Cowdery get excommunicated?
- What happened to the Book of Abraham scroll?
- Have the facsimiles been translated by modern Egyptologists?
- What were the charges against Joseph Smith when he was taken into custody before his death?
- How did Joseph Smith make money to support his family?
- How many accounts of the first vision are there?
- What was the date of the first vision?
- Why did Joseph Smith need the Gold Plates and the Urim and Thummim?
- Why can men be sealed to more than one woman but not the other way around?
- Did Lehi and Joseph Smith Sr have the same dream?
- Did Emma know about Joseph's other wives?",So my body memories are of being molested. They aren't painful because my molestation wasn't painful.

Just a vent post I suppose. Every day when I wake up I feel like just laying here, just going back to sleep and never getting up. I know this is common but. It's more than just it being too hard to get up or racing thoughts. It's just the subtle awareness that once I get up, I'll be consistently shot down by every little thing in my life; my family, my (now piling up) work, my anxiety, and sometimes even my friends and boyfriend. All of my friends and my bf are great, don't get me wrong--there's just a certain exhaustion in speaking to people and pushing out emotions. I'm tired, viscerally tired. I'd rather be unconscious. It's easier that way.","I can't stand the ones with a shitty ending, like the season 4 episode where those inbred people just... get away. Plus those weird undertones of Scully craving motherhood?

I'm currently going through a lot of mental issues and living in an unhealthy environment, so AJJ feels like a safe space. It really feels like they deeply understand.

You could try to talk to him and see where his prick-like attitude comes from. He may be carrying his own baggage that causes him to act out.

Back when I just started listening I had their songs on shuffle and backpack came on... I immediately started crying. It's such a sad premise-- finding your dead lover and carrying them off to sea. I looked it up, and well. Apparently it's inspired by Die Hard and other action movies, which just kind of made me feel silly. Despite this, I still cant listen to the song without crying. Am I the only one who has this sentiment about the song?","NTA. Both of them are being real jerks about it, and it's not like they ever consulted you on the matter.

Have a good day fellow redditor :),So since it was a new save I only 2 counties(1 tribal and clan) and I granted the tribal county to someone else to see if anything would happen (my save started from clan) and since I was in a leige I lost all ownership of the land and my levy troops decreased but it was now capped. So basically the levy troops from the tribal county were not raised. I remember reading to grant the tribal county to someone else after conquering because I was clan county. Does having another governments domain not count the troops?

Captain_Darls,"People have limits. For some people its violence, for some its death/suicide, negative feeling such as depression, racism, toxicity etc. Obviously you need to be careful about what you say, but some people will be very open to talk about certain things(for example, people on this subreddit will probably be more comfortable with the topic of suicide than most people) while some may break down just thinking about it, so you need to try understand which topics are off limits and which ones aren't for each person.","Look, I'm not trying to put you down.

Before I continue, I'd like to say this. I have high-functioning autism, and I struggle heavily when it comes to social situations. I remember once at an IEP meeting my teachers all said that I was ""a few years behind"" maturity wise. I also have bipolar disorder, and I was going through a manic episode when I decided to start dating this person. When you're in manic state, you tend to make poor decisions, you don't think before you act. With that being said, let's get to the reason I made this post.

In November 2018, I became friends with this 13 year old guy online, specifically Twitter (Let's call him Travis). I knew Travis had a crush on me; he kept dropping little hints. For example, during one of our conversations, he said that he had a crush on some other 16 year old boy who turned him down because of the age gap. When he said this, I felt like I was put in a position to be like ""well I don't mind"" because I wanted to seem cool (I'd like to add that I'm not trying to blame the victim here, it's completely my fault). So I lied and told Travis that I liked him, Travis responded and said he liked me too, and we started dating.

We dated for like 3 weeks, and during those three weeks we shared lewd pics of each other. At the time I wasn't aware that it was weird for a 16 year old and a 13 year old to date; As I said earlier I struggle with social situations, and I had never dated anyone before so I wasn't well-versed in the rules of teenage dating. I didn't want him to share any pics of himself with me, but I didn't say anything because 
1. I thought it was normal
&
2. I was worried he would get the impression that I was calling him ugly or something.
So I just decided to go along with it, I complimented him, called him cute, etc. After about 3 weeks of dating I told Travis that I was breaking up with him because I was uncomfortable with the age gap. He was totally understanding, we broke up and went back to being friends. 

I don't why I'm just now starting to feel guilty about it. It's been almost 2 years and up until 2 months ago I was completely fine just living out my life. Until suddenly, BAM, I was hit with a wall of guilt and self-loathing. I was terrified that I may have accidentally taken advantage of him or groomed him or something, so I apologized to him. Travis told me that it was totally fine, that I never manipulated him or was controlling of him, I was never abusive and I never forced him to do something that he was uncomfortable doing. He wasn't harmed by my actions, he said so himself. You'd think that hearing this directly from him would make me feel better, but I didn't. I've apologised to him multiple times because I keep expecting it to make me feel better, but it never does. All it's doing at this point is just making Travis annoyed (he told me that it's ridiculous that I still feel bad about it). 

For the past two months I've been wallowing in my own guilt and shame, I haven't been able to get anything done, I've even considered killing myself because the guilt is so overwhelming. I hate myself for being so unaware and stupid, and I feel like I'll never be able to go back to having a normal life. I feel so disgusted that I ever had the potential to do something so creepy and wrong. Mood swings are frequent, I feel like I completely ruined my own life, how could I have been so stupid? I'll be talking to a therapist about it soon, but what if it doesn't help me? What if I'm doomed to live the rest of my life with his horrible guilt weighing me down? 

This has been going on my head for the past two months. It's so hard to keep going when every single thought is one of self hatred. I don't how to end this post so I'll just stop typing.","(I'm a gay male)

For the past two months I've been wallowing in my own guilt and shame, I haven't been able to get anything done, I've even considered killing myself because the guilt is so overwhelming. I hate myself for being so unaware and stupid, and I feel like I'll never be able to go back to having a normal life. I feel so disgusted that I ever had the potential to do something so creepy and wrong. Mood swings are frequent, I feel like I completely ruined my own life, how could I have been so stupid? I'll be talking to a therapist about it soon, but what if it doesn't help me? What if I'm doomed to live the rest of my life with his horrible guilt weighing me down? 

This has been going on my head for the past two months. It's so hard to keep going when every single thought is one of self hatred. I don't how to end this post so I'll just stop typing.",You can tell me in DMs if you want

amcclurk21,"I’m not suicidal by any means. I’m just... tired of the day after day shit of the so-called “leaders” of the US continue to block legislation that would benefit the working people and pass stuff that benefits wealthy people.

What’s the point of living if we’re climbing a mountain that’s meant to be so steep that it keeps us out? All of us want to be rich enough to not work, yet, day after day we go to jobs that we don’t like (but need to pay the bills), are always tired, our food makes us fat easily and getting in shape can be extremely difficult, going to the doctor is expensive just like everything else, and now the coronavirus is canceling events left and right (not many things bring me joy these days, but being able to experience new stuff and going out did).

Hell, I worked so hard for my graduate degree and I might not even get to board the plane from my duty station to the states. I have a 4.0, which I never thought I’d have. the graduation ceremony might even be canceled.

Like, what’s the fucking point. I study leadership in my degree program and it pains me to see these people in power that don’t give a shit about anyone but themselves. I dont find joy in many things and it’s hard to get motivated. Everyone is chasing for that bigger piece of the 1% pie and I’m just tired of trying. Our “leaders” have created a culture that stifle people like me and trick us into believing that we could earn six figures one day.

I’m just looking for ideas about how other people cope with this stuff.","I’ve worked so hard for my graduate degree and I’m now concerned that the ceremonies are going to be cancelled because of the coronavirus... I’d also be flying from Japan to the US in order to walk (I didn’t buy the refundable tickets because... money)

Is anyone else in a similar boat?","Long story, but our professor has given us little to no guidance on how to complete our papers. I received a low grade on the first assignment and I emailed this professor asking for feedback. I didn’t get anything except “As I said <name>, you simply did not answers the questions.”

No rubric, no feedback. I emailed the class asking them what kind of format they used, or general guidance for this paper (which has already been graded up until this point) for how to write my next paper. Two people sent me their graded papers (they both received 100s) and I read them. 

I did use a different format for this next paper in hopes that this is what the professor is looking for, but in no way did I use other people’s words from the papers I saw (first unit was about presidents and this unit is about MLK)

Did I engage in academic misconduct?","I live overseas on a military base. I was just curious to see if I could get my tubes tied or a salpingectomy. I know I don’t want kids, and even in the smallest of small chances I change my mind, I’m sure there is a very wonderful kid in the foster system that would need a good home. But that’s a .001% of happening - I’m over even just the thought of having them.

Knowing that the answer was probably going to be no based on my age and because of the military culture, I made the appointment anyway. The doctor I had was EXTREMELY understanding and didn’t need me to tell her all the reasons I wanted to have one, didn’t ask for my husband’s permission, and didn’t try to convince me otherwise. She explained all the risks involved and the possible side effects. 

I walked out of that consult scheduled for a salpingectomy in late March 😁"

Why are you questioning if you should suck it up?? You’re so used to getting bad gifts you settled for below the bare minimum and didn’t even get that. Girl speak up.","NTA. I rolled my eyes as soon as I read microwave. How is a gift for the house a gift for you??
But the only issue you have is the color. Just tell him you love it, love the thought, and just express you guys should get a color that matches the kitchen.","Fertility issues= can’t have kids. Which is true your wife isn’t fertile. Maybe if people just accepted how people wanted to have children and didn’t always push for answers, or push for biological children you and people like you wouldn’t be caught up in situations like this. 

If a lady that had a hysterectomy, or woman born without Fallopian tubes, or just ANY reason as to why they physically can’t have kids, wanted to just say they have fertility issues instead of explaining the “real” reason, that would be okay! But since your wife is trans suddenly your sister thinks she should disclose that. Your sister is just as judgemental as your family and if you want to say fertility issues you have every right. Your sister is centering this around her and it isn’t fair. She has a close minded view on womanhood.","NAH. You have your reasons as to why your teacher may not like him. But didn’t provide any reasons why your friend doesn’t think the teacher likes him. Too much missing info and one sided. 
He’s slacked off all of highschool for as long as you’ve known him, but you don’t know his grades, and he’s made it into AP calculus??
Maybe the classes are just easy for for him...","How would you feel if your wife waited around for you to get on board with IVF and then lost her chance at having a baby because her window passed. Would you be happy that now none of you guys can have/make children?? Or would you feel even worse that your wife is probably going to feel how you feel now and never get the chance to have a child. Is that what you want??

Your wife is totally in the wrong. You guys had a conversation that you would be in the room. And in the last possible moment she took away the chance for you to be there for **your** child. 

She seems just as manipulative as your mom. She took this away from you. You told her how you felt, and all she’s done is be upset and mope? No conversation?? If it was vice versa I already know what people would be saying. Your wife needs to set boundaries with her mom ASAP or she’s going to be running the relationship.","If she’s going to come over I would bring up the incident and clearly state what you want (explanation/apology) moving forward. And if she can’t give you at least that, then honestly cut her out. She’s using the kids as an excuse to have access to you, and you’re using the kids as an excuse to not stand up for yourself. 

Why is it impossible for the kids the hang out without you and your sister being cool? That’s what boundaries are. “I have nothing to say to you further unless it’s about your daughter/setting up play dates/ etc”. You don’t need to technically have a relationship with your sister for that. And if you honestly think cutting off your sister will make her keep her daughter away from you, then that’s not your fault. And you don’t need your son around someone toxic like that.","This man comes over and spends the night with you. Tells you in the daytime that he wish you guys would’ve did more together. And instead of planning another night together you get defensive and cold. And tell him to find someone else. Expected him to just dip out while you were sleeping, but if he stayed the least he could’ve done was cook breakfast for you?? He can cook for you but can’t have a slice of pizza?? And then you try to prompt him into being your boyfriend after a few dates and a bad morning. He’s entitled because he likes you and wants a hug from you?? Why would he want to be your boyfriend after seeing how you handle things. 

Yeah he dodged a bullet.","NTA. your niece went about this all wrong. I don’t see how people are saying posting a bunch of screenshots on social media is something she had to do. 

She did a poor job of organizing in the workplace. Had no plan. And only jeopardized people’s jobs.","If you don’t get help I would suggest leaving her. At 21 she fucked up big time but if you truly forgave her and decided to build a family with her then she really doesn’t deserve a resentful partner at this point. She’s 35 with a family and your still holding this over her head from ten years ago?? That’s sooo toxic and I can’t even wonder how she feels emotionally. 

But more on you, like others suggested getting therapy is a nice first step, to hold this in so long is not healthy for yourself and has been affecting your relationship.",NTA. you asked to listen to a heartbeat. They said no. (I honestly would’ve just recorded a snippet and sent it to you as my thanks). Then they asked you for another potential ORGAN.  And you said no. But they can’t take no for an answer.

Because after hearing you and your daughter sing they definitely will.,"YTA. If you can afford to pay for your kids. And aren’t going to decline the child support. Why tf is the money not going to the kids?? Having a college fund makes them a trust fund kid?? Really? You seriously do have control issues, just not how your ex-wife is describing.","You can be a cool person but if ur bio and pics suck (personally I don’t like seeing gym poses/bodybuilding poses w/ o shirt) etc,  matches aren’t going to work in your favor.","You guys both are immature. You refused to ask her if she orgasmed to protect your selfish frail ego. Only to actually care when she childishly made Snapchat posts. 


Some advice? Stop tying your confidence to your “performance” and actually care about the other persons pleasure. It’s okay to ask questions.",YTA,Look at her headline. She was trash to begin with. You can’t let people like that get to you,"Yes we would all like to know what led up to it. But all we know are that they both have a hazy memory of the night. And they BOTH were drinking. I’m not discounting both of them so at best I’m saying it seems like a misunderstanding. 

The friend only said that she hinted at not wanting sex. She said nothing about her clothes coming off, being in the room alone, or if making out is all she wanted to do/or wanted at all. The clear details is that when she said stop he stopped. 

With all the missing details (and this is just from my POV so might be a stretch) it seems she went along with the making out and didn’t want anything further but didn’t really signal/say that. And when it got too far (naked) she finally snapped. And now she’s projecting the fact that she was too scared to do anything on to him for not reading the signs. I’m not saying it’s her fault for not speaking up, but she doesn’t explicitly say what her behavior was like while they were making out either. Just that she “hinted”. She doesn’t even say she didn’t kiss him back? So to me it seems like a big misunderstanding.","No relationships are different I agree, and privacy is a given, but this is just a different level. It’s like unresolved issues coming out in the relationship, and it’s only hurting the both of them. She just doesn’t see it yet.",That does not imply consent. Nor did she say she did any of that. They’re both pretty vague in the details.

Appropriate_Power216,"So, I have had substance abuse issues since I was a teenager. Along with that, there was always depression. Not sure which one came first, to be honest. I got sober 6 years ago in AA and within a few months I was pretty happy. The last few years I've been dealing with a lot of chronic pain issues. Even through all that, I remained pretty happy, other than having anger issues. About a year ago, I started smoking pot and did so for months without any issues. By the time the summer rolled around I was the happiest I'd been in years. I felt very fulfilled and I was really enjoying my little family. Then in July, a few weeks after having an epidural steroid injection, I developed severe pain in my back, buttocks and leg. I started taking gabapentin 3x per day and subsequently started having a lot of mental side effects. I became depressed, anxious and somewhat manic. I tried to come off the medication and ended up in severe withdrawal. Had to go back on it and taper off slowly. I've been off of it for over 2 months but I'm still dealing with depression and anxiety. I have been coming apart at the seems. I've been using drugs again to cope with the pain and self-medicate. I know I'm making things worse, but I don't know what to do. I'm scared of medications now, but I'm totally losing my ability to function. I thought I was so strong and now I feel like I can't even make decisions for myself. I cry everyday, multiple times per day. I think about suicide regularly,  but then I get more upset because I couldn't fathom leaving my wife and son behind. In addition to this, I'm dealing with chronic pain everyday. I don't know where to turn or who to see. I talked to a therapist a few months ago and all she did was just repeat back to me everything I said to her. I don't know what to do. I don't want die or be a drug addict again.","Sorry it took so long to respond. Thanks for the reply though! I don't even know if I want to waste my time trying to go to a PM clinic. I have heard they just want to give you epidural steroid injections or they won't give you pain meds. I've have had 5 of those injections and I'm pretty sure the last one is the reason why I am in so muvh pain now. I have no formal diagnosis, except a bulging disc that they say isn't compressing any nerves. Its funny they say that now, after giving me 5 fucking injections in my spine. The spine specialist now acts all confused, like they can't imagine I'm in so much pain. I tried valium a little bit here and there. It does seem to help some, but prefer ativan. I know it can help with the muscle spasms. I just worry about dependency on benzos. Getting off of them is next to impossible. I'd rather be on methadone my whole life than on benzos for a few months. Outside of short term or as needed use, they scare the shit out of me. I know methadone is tough to kick, but I don't know if I have much of choice. I have to be able to function because I have a family to take care of, ya know? There is a private clinic close by here, and I may end up going there. No doctor is going to give me opioids. The only thing is, a want to continue smoking weed and I heard that  most of those places are sticklers about it.","Its always been corner bags where I'm from. Never seen a bundle before, ever.","I've typically had to wait 36-48 hours before subs helped me. I always started with a very small amount, like an 8th of a pill. You can always take more. I went into precip withdrawal with on an 8th before but I was able to break through it with some dope.","Ahh man, the pain I've been through this year, I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. At this point, I'm not even sure what to do. I've tried every opioid alternative there is and it hasn't done shit. Gabapentin worked but gave me terrible side effects.  So you went to the clinic for the methadone and use it for pain control? I have considered that option, honestly.",Cross contamination ?,"Been out of the life for 6 years. Got out at 25, after struggling with relapses for 5 years before that. Recently did pain pills again because I've been suffering debilitating pain for months. Never thought I'd put an opioid in my body again. Trying to stay away from dope though. Had no problem smoking weed and shit over the last year. I was in AA for 5 years but kind of drifted away last year. I know one thing for sure, the dope game isn't like it used to be.","Haven't done dope in 6 years, but it looks like the shit I was getting back around '08, which was straight fucking fire. The pins and needles in my face hurt so good after I did a shot.",Glad you're friend is okay,Yes dude! That's exactly what happened to me! It happened to me more than once. But one time I was in the hospital for a few days. I did a wash and it then it started right after that. I was by myself and had to call my buddy to come get me. By the time i got to the hospital all my muscles were cramped up and spasmed. I was screaming and yelling until they gave me some Ativan to calm me down. They wouldn't give me anything for pain. Treated me like straight trash.,"Hell yeah man, congrats! Keep that shit up!","Yeah man, I haven't done dope since 2014, and I haven't had dope like that since prob '08 or '09. We used to sit around sick all day just to wait for the dude that had that shit. He would only fuck with you if you had a least $100. We'd all get high and have some left over. Those were the days. Lol Didn't even know shit like that was still around.","This looks like the shit I used to get back around '08. It was some of the best dope I ever did. Hard as a rock, all dissolved in water and kept me well all fucking day.","It happened to me several times back in the day. Just like someone else mentioned, probably ""cotton fever"" from a bacteria. I ended up in the hospital with  like that once. Severe headache, uncontrollable shaking, hyperventilating and severe muscle cramps. It was one of the most painful things I've ever experienced.","If this is a real question, don't fucking do it, please. You'll regret the decision the rest of your life.","Yeah, its like a tiny little shot that looks like one of those energy shots. K-shot I think its called. They have like 7-9 grams of leaf condensed into a little shot. Apparently it fucks you up royally. Some people withdrawal different than others that's for sure.",I could definitely see how that would be the case. The mother of one of my friends who died a few years ago from a fent OD is one of those people trying to get it banned. He did it before he turned back to dope and she blames it on the kratom. She doesn't know where to turn her anger and hurt. I'm sure there are a ton of people out there that are doing the same think as her. I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. My mom has struggled with opioid addiction off and on my whole life. A few months ago she was hooked on those concentrate shots from the gas station. She definitely went through WDs off of it but it was no different than regular opioid WD.,"You may want to go to hospital. It could be colitis, pancreatitis or appendicitis.","I've read the WDs are worse than dope because of all the other alkaloids in kratom. Have you heard this? I was on another sub and these dudes were saying that they took subs to help with the kratom WD and the subs didn't even full work. But hey, I suppose it's better than methadone. I'm all for harm reduction and what ever keeps people from dying. I've read that about the different strains. Someone told me to try bali red for pain relief.","I know what you mean about the weed. It certainly does help. It sucks though because sometimes it makes me anxious as fuck and other times it doesn't. I probably wouldn't be able to sleep without it though. Its not legal where I live and I can't consistently get strains that work for me. Stay strong when you get home my friend. Staying busy definitely helps, that's for sure, and so does having support. I need to reach back out to all my sober friends.","I'm not in WV, but I'm in that region.  Most of the east and the midwest is all dealing with same shit. I feel better after talking to everyone on here though. I'm glad I made this post. Thank you","So glad your 23 days clean! Congrats! That's amazing! Back when I was using before, I had never OD'ed and went to the hospital. But I know that would be in my near future now, or worse. Keep going with sobriety! You can make it! You did 5 years before and that's no easy accomplishment.","It does, for real. As many times as I was in and out of sobriety, I should know that shit. I relapsed 5 times though my early 20s. I would get 6 months, a year, 9 months, year and half, but I would always go back. It wasn't until this last time that sustained any long term sobriety. I don't want to lose it all again man. I love my family so much. Thanks though my dude, I appreciate it.",Thanks!,"I went back out on a sub back in 2014. I had been clean for like 6 months. The sub just made me barf my brains out and gave me a terrible headache for like 2 days. After it wore off, I went and got some dope. Sorry to hear you're still struggling. This shit is no joke.","Congrats on your clean time! It was so hard to tell on myself. I was crying so hard i didn't have a choice. I knew what I was about to her and my son. I walked in the house and she was doing homework with him, I just broke down immediately.",Congrats on your daughter dude! Thanks for the kind words. I hope you can reel it in and be there for your kid!,"Thanks bro. I'm going to call one of my old AA buddies today and go back to a meeting. I miss those people anyway. I used to be all in on that stuff. Going to 5 meetings a week, sponsoring people, chairing meetings, regular inventories and all that other stuff. Only reason I left is because I got busy and just didn't make it a priority. I'd rather go back now then come crawling in looking like skeletor, half dead, with no one left to support me. I've been at that point and I owe it to my family not to go back. I hate that you're stuck out there. I hate that anyone is stuck. There's never a good outcome with this shit, ever. I'm fooling myself to think I'm going to be okay getting high a few times. There is never just one.","Yeah, there is no point if there is no legs and no euphoria. That's why I started doing dope in '07, the euphoria was amazing and I'd be high all day off a point. I guess this is the catalyst we needed for addicts to start getting some care and some harm reduction. Just sad that so many people had to lose their lives.","I'm sorry you haven't seen your son. That shit breaks my heart, for real. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I needed to read all of this. But you're right, the Percs immediately set it off. I haven't even thought about dope much over the last few years, even while smoking weed here and there. As soon as I took that perc, I wanted more."

Trombone_treehugger5,"i've been feeling like this for the past week or so:

im usually quite motivated in school but now, especially with online learning, i really can't be bothered. i think my grades have been dropping. the only thing i enjoy in school now is history class because the teacher is cool.

i feel so tired and drained of energy throughout almost the whole day

i feel so hopeless about the world cuz it's so crap and i want to make a change but theres just so much to do

im so sad. i dont know why. i feel like there is a reason but i cant remember

when i get into trouble it's because im so stubborn and i feel like i am crap and a failure and useless and worthless and ungrateful and my parents deserve someone better and i want them to cane me (i used to be caned in chinese school) but i dont want them to ask them so i want to cane myself. but i never do it

most days i just want to fade away. i feel like my soul and heart are heavy and so so tired. i just want to fade away into nothingness, into non existence and just rest. 

sometimes i get mad at my friends over text (im still in lockdown) but i dont show it because i dont want to hurt them. i don't know why i get mad but it takes me like an hour to calm down. 

sometimes i feel like im dead inside and im barely functioning. like im a robot

i can't cry. i want to let it all out and scream and cry but i can't. the tears just won't come. i feel like i've lost the ability to cry...

Also, she told me that ""it hurts more not when your friend betrays you, but when they used you"", saying that they even had the audacity to hack into her accounts). And she's been told to kill herself once by people from our year group. Besides that, she gets (panic i think) attacks where she takes hours to calm down and has difficulty breathing.

thefusiocean,"I am literally crying while i am writing this .For a moment when I think upon my achievements as a 20 yr old male , i found nothing to cherish upon . i have no friends , i am not very well attached to brother ,sister ,family . it is not that i don't have friends now i never had friends . obviously i had no girlfriend , i have never kissed , in fact i had never talked with someone so as to reveal my feelings . It is not that I am physically weak, ugly or something but i don't want to get attached to someone . 

&#x200B;

i tried dating a girl 1 year ago , i was fine telling her that i love her ,she accepted . then suddenly some thought came to mind that she will become burden to me , i am not good enough for her ,she will leave me , if she leaves me then i will be devastated , i will loose my freedom, my life will be limited but actually i was only insecure about myself , i broke up. but the fact is i still thinks about her , her memory haunts me . I feel so lonely ,useless,incompatible.

&#x200B;

It is not only about socially. I am also broke academically now. But this was not the case always. I always came first in my class till college, because my parents were so strict , they used to send me to tution even i have 1 hr spare from  my school, i managed to get every scholarship. i was kinda hero in my neighbourhood . but i had no friend, then i went to college and lived in college hostel . I had many dreams about colleges but somehow my parents were able to take that from me by giving me in that residential college, i made some friends there but not too good only casual friends. somehow i did good in higher secondary school. but i have been exhausted by all of this, all of this social social norm,standards,values,studies.

&#x200B;

then comes the graduation but to get a good graduation college i had to compete in an national level entrance test. to prepare for that i took a year drop, and finally i got to live freely in  a city, i can go anywhere, eat anything . but i guessed it was too much for a desperate guy who haven't even tasted pizza in his whole life, who haven't ever for once gone with his family to a picnic , a holiday trip. so there in the exposure of city i tried something .i tried to date that girl i have said before.I ate some new dishes . but still it was not enough for me , i had always a void for friends. and also my family wasn't giving me enough money to do whatever i want. still my hopes were unsatiated . i broke up with that girl and i regret till date. 

&#x200B;

whatever the year ended and  i gave the entrance exam , i did worse than the previous year . suddenly i became a worthless child. the respect i had gathered over the year was lost. i took admission in a tier-3 engineering college .

&#x200B;

I remember that as a child i could easily remember information, even in college i was good with calculus,kinamatics. but now i have forgotten even the simple formulas of physics. I can't hold information in my head any more. 

&#x200B;

i become very sad , i cry.  to escape the reality i watch movies, web series . i can't focus on studies any more. i don't remember last time had a good sleep, i always forced myself to sleep.

&#x200B;

every morning i think today will be my day, i will fix everything . and every night i sleep with the regret that i have lost  yet another day, i won't be a scientist anymore.

touching me inappropriately multiple times i remembered trying to tell my parents but them not listening i rememberd why im afraid of hospitals and doctors. i remember everything.,omg that's the cutest thing ive ever seen❤,if you zoom in you can see somethings i missed and messed up on,i 100% support this. everything that has happened to me and many many others you are not alone and will always have a voice i love every single one of you you're are wonderful and great people. and anyone who's reading this remember i care and so do many others don't be afraid to tell people because they will believe you and help you. hugs💕❤,i did,Every single time i wear a mask i have to if not others worry. i have people to talk to throughout the day but im still so fucking depressed and lonely its easy to hide my feelings and emotions in text but in person it's so hard. the past few days I've just been sleeping till 6pm because i hate being awake and my dreams make me content. i went to a halloween party and still felt alone like i was just apart of the background even though i had people and my two friends talking to me and spending time with me. i look and feel miserable everyday to the point of it bringing down others. i get bashed for staying inside by my parents (not my fault i have no desire to leave) and now am being forced into a private school opposed to my more comfortable home schooling all because they feel ashamed their daughter sits inside. they've expressed a distaste in my dream of becoming and artist they say its lazy and pointless it'll never take me anywhere. i just want a hug is that too much to ask for to feel some kind of affection by people who are supposed to love me.,holy shit i am so so so sorry your brother is a horrible person for doing this things with you its not your fault💕❤❤,anytime sweetie hugs💕💕💞,yes. that is considered rape he took advantage of you for a sexual purpose. im so sorry that happened to you remember you're not alone❤,so sorry my apologies i removed it from my comment it was very rude of me❤,"sweetheart listen to me do not blame yourself ever. i was abused by my brothers friend who forced a ""romantic"" relationship on me i was too young to understand that type of stuff. i know your feelings i felt like i loved him too but trust me its not love its a coping mechanism by the brain too make you feel like it wasn't rape but consensual. ill help you the best i can. don't make the same mistake as me and not tell anyone it only ends in more victims. i love you sweetie hugs❤❤💕💕💞💞💞",my brother came up to visit us yesterday and i decided it was time to tell him what happened to me. so today i decided to ask how his was friend (my abuser) and he told me he cut ties with him a year or two ago. i asked why he said he went to prison for offended two young girls. when i heard that it made me sick to my stomach and i started to feel responsible for it. if i would said something years ago about what had happened between me and him those two little angels wouldn't have to live a lifetime of trauma and pain. even though i was disgusted i kept my composure and told him what his friend did to me years prior. we talked for like an hour when i was finished telling him he looked pale he started to cry and blame himself he told me he always knew his friend and i's relationship seem odd. he said he should've noticed earlier and it was his fault for even bringing him close to me. it's not his fault i told him his friend is responsible for everything he couldn't have noticed. he calm down after i told him that. i felt awful opening up about it what a bomb to drop on someone after not seeing them for 6 years.,my brother came up to visit us yesterday and i decided it was time to tell him what

I've been studying it a lot on PubMed, Blogs, Youtube videos and comments.

Just want to help as much as I can, so feel free to ask anything =)","You said ""many get worse"", can you link me up to the study where that is proven, please?","Ketamine is used as anesthetic since 1962 so it's probably legal in all over the world! I've only tried 2 different SSRI's and decided to jump to Ketamine treatments. It was just a matter of founding a clinic, getting there and even tho he told me ""you haven't tried as many antidepressants, there is more to try"" I said ""I know, you are right, now let's do some ketamine?"" and he agreed. There is no reason not to accept as it has even been labeled as a ""miraculous"" drug!

*""The results from this small study suggested that ketamine was a miracle drug—lifting a person’s mood almost immediately. Reporting in the* [*Archives of General Psychiatry*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16894061)*, they showed that 70 percent of depressed patients responded to ketamine within 24 hours. By contrast, in one of the largest studies of people with depression, only one-third of patients responded to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) after eight weeks."" -* [source](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/party-drug-turned-antidepressant-approaches-approval/)","Grato por indicar esse link, vou lá conversar com o povo!",Cuidar dos outros é cuidar de mim também =),Oh!

My thoughts exactly!!

>I'm not a fan of the models where people are packed in a room and hooked up to an IV surrounded by people they don't know with very little preparation.

I think that psychiatrists believe that the chemical in ketamine is doing all the work, they even tried to produce a ketamine with no hallucination effects! I mean.. I believe the trip is an important part.. But someone related to me huge improvements to his depression even without having any hallucination at all so.. Anyways, ket being treated as any other drug is just wrong for me, the doctor should recommend songs and talk about how important they are and such.. But at the same time there are people who listen to nothing and have benefits, oh hell I don't know what to do kkkk","Essa semana vou comprar! Já usei umas 2-3 vezes mas para fins recreativos.

Então eles não estão como em uma anestesia geral? Ainda não entendi a diferença entre anestesia geral e anestesia com quetamina, poderia explicar?

Quando a analgesia, você acredita que quetamina pode ser usado para dor cronica?","Wow, that's is very nice to hear! Thanks for sharing.

Regarding as not being better anymore, what didn't you go back to have another infusion? And how long did it last for you until the effects worn off?","• São 2x por semana por 3 semanas. Fiz as duas com 0,5ml/kg e não obtive efeito antidepressivo nenhum, então essas próximas duas serão 0,75ml/kg, se não fizer efeito as últimas 2 são 1ml/kg. Caso eu não responda a nenhum desse o tratamento  é interrompido. Caso eu responda, continuarem com a quantidade de aplicações necessárias, podendo ser 1 ou 2 por semana como 1 por mês. Ainda não há evidências sobre quanto tempo dura ou o que faz com que ela dure ou se pessoas já foram curadas com ela.

• Efeito colateral é que após a infusão eu levo uns 15 minutos pra levantar porque tô meio tonto, mas é uma tontura ok, levemente agradável. 

&#x200B;

• Sem resultados ainda, dose 50% maior essa semana.

&#x200B;

• Pau e intestino show de bolas.

&#x200B;

• Convênio pode cobrir mas com limiar na justiça.

• São R$ 500 por aplicação, Clinica OHR, fala com dr. ivan

Grato por todos esses detalhes. Então você da quetamina para eles dissociarem, mas nesse momento eles ficam alucinando ou a dose é para apagarem? Porque durante minhas viagens tenho medo de alguém tocar em mim ou eu bater meu braço.. imagina tomar um banho com o corpo queimado!! Ia ser assustador demais eu penso. Conta mais sobre quetamina! x)","Porra, velho, valeu demais :’) ... eu continuo gravando até hoje, estou pelos dias 1230","Já tomei ayahuasca 5 vezes antes da depre e 1 vez depois. Antes da deprê eu dançava por horas seguidas feito uma cigana.. depois da deprê só conseguia ficar parado e chorando. Com a cetamina fazendo bons efeitos, irei parar com a medicação e considerar ayahuasca :)

• Como consegui prescrição: a clínica é de um médico, psiquiatra, psicologo e hipnoterapeuta então foi só chegar e falar “já tomei venlafaxina e desvenlafaxina” e ele “hm, você tentou pouca coisa” e eu “sim, verdade, bora fazer cetamina então?” e ele “bora.” Kkk

• Chama Clinica OHR, com Dr. Ivan, pode falar que eu que indiquei pq to curtindo mto o trampo dele.

• Uma enfermeira fica na sala com 2 pacientes, ambos com frequência cardíaca sendo observada e pressão tirada a cada 10 min. To lá no meio da trip intensa com a geometria sagrada e de repente o bagulho começa apertar meu braço pra tirar pressão kkk e ai eu penso “coração, fica de boa ai ein, a trip ta daora não vai cagueta nois não” kkk

• Eu não sabia que tinha uma viagem envolvida então fui mó inocente só achando que meu pé ia formigar.. e ai paaaa, começou as brisa intensa e eu pensei “cacete, to com uma agulha no braço..” mas como é uma anestesia chega uma hora que você nem sente, e por ser dissociativa chega uma hora que não existe mais “meu braço”! E se você se permitir, não existe nem mais “meu corpo”, você só flutua. No meio da trip eu pensei “basicamente eu paguei um médico pra me drogar dentro de uma clinica kkkkk” pareceu tipo ir no puteiro pra aprender inglês, sei lá kk

Quaisquer mais perguntas, pode mandar o/","Que bom que salvou o comentário :) - espero que acrescente algo!

Acabei de ler todo o desabafo e até o link.. caralh* velho :( .. A psiquiatria é realmente um jogo de palpites, e tem psicólogos péssimos por ai, concordo total.

Essa semana tive uma crise do nada, to sem grana, minha mina termina comigo, sou processado, tudo dentro de 7 dias, cristo. To fazendo terapia, hipnoterapia, infusão cetamina, tomando desvenlafaxina, amanhã tomo 300ug lsd e to pra comprar psilocibina tanto 5g para experiências completas como capsulas de 0,5g para uso diário.

Depression is hard to deal with, have you been seeing a therapist? It definitely helps. I had 2 infusions, which did nothing, but they said they start slow 0,5ml/kg and if I don’t respond they change to 0,75ml/kg and if it doesn’t work too, 1ml/kg, which a reddit user said it’s the perfect dose for him.

Trombone_treehugger5,"i've been feeling like this for the past week or so:

im usually quite motivated in school but now, especially with online learning, i really can't be bothered. i think my grades have been dropping. the only thing i enjoy in school now is history class because the teacher is cool.

i feel so tired and drained of energy throughout almost the whole day

i feel so hopeless about the world cuz it's so crap and i want to make a change but theres just so much to do

im so sad. i dont know why. i feel like there is a reason but i cant remember

when i get into trouble it's because im so stubborn and i feel like i am crap and a failure and useless and worthless and ungrateful and my parents deserve someone better and i want them to cane me (i used to be caned in chinese school) but i dont want them to ask them so i want to cane myself. but i never do it

most days i just want to fade away. i feel like my soul and heart are heavy and so so tired. i just want to fade away into nothingness, into non existence and just rest. 

sometimes i get mad at my friends over text (im still in lockdown) but i dont show it because i dont want to hurt them. i don't know why i get mad but it takes me like an hour to calm down. 

sometimes i feel like im dead inside and im barely functioning. like im a robot

i can't cry. i want to let it all out and scream and cry but i can't. the tears just won't come. i feel like i've lost the ability to cry...

So, I'm still in middle school (in Asia) and I have a friend who I think has BPD. And she has been affected by past experiences (she just told me that once a friend faked suicide on text and she's still shaken about it). She's had so many friend problems (she changes best friends a lot and recently someone hurt her a lot. Also, she told me that ""it hurts more not when your friend betrays you, but when they used you"", saying that they even had the audacity to hack into her accounts). And she's been told to kill herself once by people from our year group. Besides that, she gets (panic i think) attacks where she takes hours to calm down and has difficulty breathing.

She doesn't want her parents to know and I really don't know how to help her. We are not extremely close but still...I can't bear to see her suffer so much.

Also, there's a thing in Norway I think where there are people who defend animals in court, like animal rights and stuff. Eg the wolves. It's called NOAH (Norwegian Council for Animal Ethics). That could be something to check out

serendipity0320,I’ve tried getting out and about but it just brings those feelings there. I know it’s not helping :/,"For me, I had to tell myself that if I didn’t go through with it, it would be worse than actually going through it. I told myself that there would be more sleepless nights that would feel like an eternity and it made me muster up the energy and get checked out. After, I felt amazing. It was a HUGE wave of relief.. even if I still worry about health here and there, its not near as bad as NOT knowing.
That’s just me though!","I’ve had the same problem for over a month. I’d contemplate on calling 911 and be racing around the house in a panic. Eventually, I did go to the doctor and just like you, he said everything was fine. Perfect health. I didn’t mention my panic attacks to him because at the time, I genuinely thought it was a heart attack or my body was giving up. He could somehow tell that I was having an episode of some sort right in front of him. It was probably the constant shaking of my leg but he told me that stress will do unimaginable things to our bodies. The doctors would have surely found something by now. 

It’s important to take control and tell yourself that you are healthy and alive. Your mind can completely convince you otherwise and I know it’s difficult because I have to do it daily, but only WE are in control. 

Best of luck to you!","One time I was up all night because I kept thinking how horrible my memory was becoming due to anxiety. I just kept thinking how it was putting permanent holes (which it wasn’t) in my brain. I’d forget conversations or what happened in a video I was watching.

It could be everything going on in the world that you’re subconsciously aware about. Or it could be the uncertainty of tomorrow. One day after work back in January, I had one out of the blue and couldn’t seem to understand why. I was racing around the house trying to catch my breath, when I realized it was because I had previously learned about Kobe’s death. Sounds silly, BUT the shock it gave me was enough to cause that. 

Also, heartburn is another one I have. It’s absolutely common! Try and trust the doctor even if it’s difficult to grasp. Lol I had to tell myself too. I’m currently not taking anything because I so badly want to control this myself. I also hear that medications can make it worse the first week, so that scares me. I have major health anxiety so another word of advice: don’t google too much. Every symptom you have will be blown up and have you thinking you’re deathly ill. I learned the hard way!","Mine have started a little over a month ago and can totally relate. Between personal problems and everything going on in the world, it’s gotten the worst in my life too. The one word of advice I want to start off with: don’t think of yourself as sabotaging any relationships you have with anyone. It will mentally dig you into a deeper state of panic and worry and that is exactly what I did. 

I have to tell myself that even though I’m going through a mental hailstorm, everyone has their own battles as well. Some that we will never even imagine. Take deep breaths and focus on the exhale when you feel yourself having an episode. Think of the positives that you have in your life like your health, roof over your head, a loving partner and friends. I do this and it drastically helps!","My entire body changed in a matter of a week. I went days without sleeping, I was chugging water left and right because I felt so dehydrated, I was having blurred vision, and my mouth went completely dry. It seriously felt like my body was about to give out. But after a doctors visit, he told me that anxiety can and will do crazy things to us. Nothing is abnormal so if you find yourself getting worried, just know that because I had NO clue and that caused me even more panic.",I don’t get the chest tingling BUT its different in everyone and tingling sensations are normal when having anxiety! I would feel it in my face and then go completely numb.,"Every time I drink, it’s immensely regretted. My heart races and I don’t know if it’s because I’m thinking OF it racing or if my body just can’t handle it with all the stress in daily life. So, keep it to a minimum. Wish I was that fun, bubbly person I use to be when I had a few cocktails lol","Seriously. Go YOU. And that’s a perfectly normal response to the past, it just sucks because it’s always on your mind :/","Yes this is it! I’m going next week again, so we will see. Anything to relax the hamster wheels from turning at night lol","When it comes to our health, mentally/physically, we will do anything to feel at ease. & you’re spot on with the “separating what’s real and what’s not”. I’ve been walking through my days with a sort of fog in my head. Everything is blurred and I question if I’m dreaming countless times a day

You are not alone!","I know what this is like. I’m currently temporarily laid off and have been for a month. I know it’s not the same but you have to think of the “positives”. Write them out in your notes or even put the notes on your mirror to remind yourself that you may not have a job but now you have open opportunities for an even better one. You belong right where you are now. Just have to keep your eyes open and chin up

It’s easier said than done, I know.",That’s worrisome to think about.... it makes you think that we wouldn’t “know” until too late (this is me panicking again).,You don’t realize how much this reply eased me. Not saying I’m glad anyone goes through this but I went to urgent care a week ago! Did you feel better after when they said nothing was wrong? Because I did at first but then the thoughts came right back. Trying to figure out if it’s really in our heads or our bodies telling us stuff.,Thank you for that because today’s been tough with it for sure,It’s insane to me how our brains can literally think us into having it. Blocking it is hard.. and I feel like we lose touch with our real selves due to all this worry. Just wanna feel like old me,That is scary to have to hear at any age but I can’t imagine as being a kid.. I’m sorry for that! :/,I’ll have to look into that. I really do appreciate it! It means the world to me that people will reach out and help a total stranger. Xoxo,I’m so sorry about that. I would definitely have a hard time not thinking the worst. We just have to try I suppose. Day by day ugh,I’ve never been diagnosed so I’m unsure! It’s just lately because I’ve been down with anxiety so it’s spiking... And exactly. I lose sleep over it :/,Web MD is my absolute nightmare so I’m totally aware of that feeling :( it’s horrible and I’m sorry you’re going through it too. My panic attacks are almost all day... ahhhh best of luck to you!,Lately I’ve been scaring myself with the idea I have cancer because I’m going through a rough patch and I guess my brain is deciding to make things even worse! It all started when I was drinking one day and woke up with my cheeks feeling more full and chubby. My brain read that as cancer and I can’t stop feeling the “fullness” of my cheeks either. I’m freaking out and just want to know if anyone’s had this happened ://,"I feel like this is something that lots of people have a difficult time understanding. Anxiety, even being surrounded by people you know, is still just as bad as being alone. Try starting off with how they’ve been, talk about relationships, their jobs or schooling (if they’re in school). Things will flow once you start from there. And then they’ll be asking you questions too! Try not to over think on your questions, either. Good luck!","It’s been almost a month and every night before bed I have it and then again, right when I wake up. There’s no way to rid of it unless I try and think *happy thoughts* but sometimes that doesn’t even work.","This is me to a T. Everything from the tight chest, to the numbness of the face. The only way to ease mine is to be with people. Or the sound of my parents’ voices. 

Sorry if it’s not much of help but try that. And also try to focus on your exhale breathing! Best of luck",I see your point!,"He’s 26 and making insensitive “jokes” like that? Without any remorse for you feeling upset? Along with the fact that your mother has an illness... I’m getting angry just typing this. 

Run for the hills, girl. It’s not that easy but I promise you, that is NOT the kind of love anyone deserves. He sounds like a chump.","Very sticky situation but you also have to keep in mind that if she harmed herself over the fact that he didn’t like her, how would she feel if she found out you two were dating and he liked you the whole time? She’s your friend. Not someone you don’t know nor care for. And I’m not saying you cannot be happy, but DEFINITELY explain things in person and understand her emotions if she is unhappy/sad about it. Empathy goes a long way.

This is just what I would do! Best of luck <3"

I have depression all the time since my teenage years increasing and decreasing or being too dense to cope with or to the point forgetting its existence and i could fucking mock about it.

I am so tired that my mind cannot compherend even the basic things such as basic sentences in daily conversations or forgetting them without any clear reason. I am too afraid to take my life, i have tried and planned couple of times but i am such a pussy to being that brave. I have always tried to make myself courageous to see the better days. You know what they say if you wanna see the better days, you have to be there. But i forgot what a good day is. I forgot who i am. I am sick of everything including myself.

Trombone_treehugger5,"i've been feeling like this for the past week or so:

im usually quite motivated in school but now, especially with online learning, i really can't be bothered. i think my grades have been dropping. the only thing i enjoy in school now is history class because the teacher is cool.

i feel so tired and drained of energy throughout almost the whole day

i feel so hopeless about the world cuz it's so crap and i want to make a change but theres just so much to do

im so sad. i dont know why. i feel like there is a reason but i cant remember

when i get into trouble it's because im so stubborn and i feel like i am crap and a failure and useless and worthless and ungrateful and my parents deserve someone better and i want them to cane me (i used to be caned in chinese school) but i dont want them to ask them so i want to cane myself. but i never do it

most days i just want to fade away. i feel like my soul and heart are heavy and so so tired. i just want to fade away into nothingness, into non existence and just rest. 

sometimes i get mad at my friends over text (im still in lockdown) but i dont show it because i dont want to hurt them. i don't know why i get mad but it takes me like an hour to calm down. 

sometimes i feel like im dead inside and im barely functioning. like im a robot

i can't cry. i want to let it all out and scream and cry but i can't. the tears just won't come. i feel like i've lost the ability to cry...

tysm in advance \*sad smile\*",tysm!,"me too! i want to write a song for a friend to cheer her up, and i kinda want to start a blog",tysm!,"All kids want to be Gryffindors at first because that's what the main characters were.

So, I'm still in middle school (in Asia) and I have a friend who I think has BPD. And she has been affected by past experiences (she just told me that once a friend faked suicide on text and she's still shaken about it). She's had so many friend problems (she changes best friends a lot and recently someone hurt her a lot. Also, she told me that ""it hurts more not when your friend betrays you, but when they used you"", saying that they even had the audacity to hack into her accounts). And she's been told to kill herself once by people from our year group. Besides that, she gets (panic i think) attacks where she takes hours to calm down and has difficulty breathing.

She doesn't want her parents to know and I really don't know how to help her. We are not extremely close but still...I can't bear to see her suffer so much.

Also, there's a thing in Norway I think where there are people who defend animals in court, like animal rights and stuff. Eg the wolves. It's called NOAH (Norwegian Council for Animal Ethics). That could be something to check out

Pitiful_Walk,"by football i mean the American football.

i really love watching football, i mean i can watch any team plays be it college or NFL, but then the broadcasters talk about a player salary or the the fact that he's a freshman and then when i really feel like SH\*T, i mean these men are playing/doing something that they enjoy doing, and they are getting paid to do it (i know that this is not the case for college players but at least they get their tuition paid off and the top players are guaranteed a draft pick). 

i often say to myself that ""i will just watch just  the big game this week"" but when the first Saturday/Sunday game start, you will find in front of my pc flipping through the games!

i think i should just consider football as an addiction and try to just stop watching it until i get my sh\*t together!, but then i feel like i will be missing all the cool stuff that will happen each year (if you are a football fan then you will know what i'm talking about)

so i'm just looking for advice on how to handle this!

i stopped watching soccer because i started seeing these 17 and 18 years old playing and made me realize that i'm nowhere near achieving my goals, but then i most football players are just younger or close to my age!

LofaKing,"I know when all of these started, I was 15, I got the chance to go to my dream Uni in the country, but my family just suffered from a recent death, and my Mom did let my study in the Uni that I wanted to go. I blamed my Mom and myself for not speaking up early and maybe I still had the chance to catch up. But I did. I lost all motivation to study. 

I FELT LOST THEN. I FELT EVERYONE ARE BETTER THAN ME. I FELT LIKE I'M THE WORTHLESS GUY. 

I kept telling my parents that I wasn't happy with the course I was taking. But my parents told me to just study as it would be just a waste of time and money to shift courses but the never listened. 

Somehow I finished the course. I wasn't happy on my graduation day. I FELT I COULD'VE DONE BETTER. My Mom and Dad were happy. But I wasn't. I got the degree, but I didn't learn anything. 

My parents wanted me to go straight to Med school. But I held myself and said that I want to take gap year (wait a year or two). 

I took up night work instead of a day job, so that I can been far from the stress of daily life. 

Two years have passed, and in those 2 years I worked hard and didn't spent a penny on myself and opened a small business just to help myself and the family with the tuition. And just in case something happens to me. I know I had my family sorted out. But I am still not well. I want to end everything. I want it to stop. I cry at night. I'm lost. I don't know what is happening. 

Now I am in Med school. To follow the Dream that I want to be a doctor. But I have no motivation. I don't study at all. I can't focus. I feel like everytime I have to study, I will fail.

On a practical  note, can you make it mandatory for your students to turn on their cameras and mics during your classes and encourage them to ask questions? Maybe they are getting negative vibes from you and they are either disinterested (due to your own low mood which could be affecting how you come across to your students) or scared/intimidated and don't want to speak up. I'm just hazarding a guess here.

Do speak to a therapist if you can. Alternately, is there another trusted teacher you can talk to? Maybe they might be having similar experiences?

Previously, I always added water to the pellets but now that the weather is getting warmer (I'm in the southern hemisphere so we're getting close to summer), I had to stop wetting the pellets because the food was starting to spoil after a few hours.

My quails seem to either be not eating, or eating a lot less than they used to. Should I wait and see if they will start eating the dry pellets? I'm not sure if they are having trouble swallowing the pellets, they are just standard game bird pellets and should be small enough for them to swallow. Do you think it would help if I ground the pellets into a powder? I used to do that when they were chicks but now they are 6 months old and I think they should be able to swallow them whole.

Shakabanaleible,"I had just asked him “what should I write about” as I’m a writer. I’ve been blocked for months and can’t seem to get back into the flow of things. He told me to look into lack of male support in the depression region. 

I asked him “do you think there is a lack of support”, he said. “Yeah sometimes, from man to man”. I thought it was interesting that of all things to ask me to write about he chose that, but I realise now that it would really help him too and that’s all I want. 

So I ask, as a man dealing with depression do you feel like you are not allowed to express your emotions? Is it more man to man difficulty? Is there a resource or outlet you have? Private message me if you feel like it. I think it would really go a long way into trying to help someone, we all have our battles and I appreciate him asking me to learn about this.","I wanna be that person who feels comfortable hugging there friends, walking straight up just you know cuddling on the couch whatever.

I even said that and they just said ‘we know ur not a huggish person’, so now theres absaloutly no way im going to rock up and hug them or that rheyre gonna hug me. How tf do people just kiss eachother cuddle on the couch without 7-10 months of psyching urself out of it.","I used to come on reddit a lot to write stuff reply to people asking for advice but truthfully advice is easiest to give when you’re doing not so great for yourself. Now I wake up and I don’t want to get out of bed my head kind of feels itchy (metaphorically) because I’m so bored out of my mind and the first thought that comes to mind every morning is “what is the purpose of getting up today”, there’s non. I’ve pushed away all my friends and not because I hate them I love em to death but every time I talk to them I feel guilty as hell and I come home and I just stare into space and do nothing but feel crappy. 

During quarintine it’s not like I see them that often but I don’t have any communication with them now, used to talk to them almost all day every day now it’s barely nothing but they refuse to let me push them away. They’re the kind of friends who we’ve bonded emotionally and we have so much trust they are always there for me and me for them. But right now I don’t want them to be, I’ve been shutting out my emotions most of the time because they’re too difficult to deal with btw I’m F16 from Australia. 

Most days I don’t get out of bed and I find my phone repulsive a lot of the time now too because it makes me feel claustrophobic I guess. So I just stare at the wall for hours on end and when I finally stand up to go outside my room I almost faint because I’m not used to it. I barely eat and when I do it’s forced, I can’t sleep most nights and when I do I have vivid dreams of the people I’m closest to dying. I wake up in a cold sweat in tears.

People think that talking to people helps you and yes it does but recently doing that has just made me feel judged and insecure and just worse. I have this one friend who is overly nice she’s the person who here’s me open up the most and I’m the same for her. She’s so nice that it’s the only annoying thing about her, it never annoyed me before but I don’t know why but her being nice to me reassuring me, saying things to help me makes me want to crawls out of my skin I guess that makes me a horrible person.

I can’t figure out what is going on, the world doesn’t feel real right now everything seems so fake I keep remembering I guess what you would cal ‘past trauma’ thinking about time in the hospital feeling guilty. If you read this far thank you cuz I haven’t been able to say anything to anyone that I know even if I can’t tell if anyone’s hearing me.","My closest friend. Enfj for about 6 months I’ve been making sure that she’s ok always listening to her and she returns the favour. She’s the person I open up to. I’m F16 infp and she’s F15 enfj. When I found my MBTI type I kind of hated the description because it wasn’t how I saw myself. It was a hard pill to swallow to realise that’s more or less who I am, I had to learn about everyone around me and my self to realise that the test results showing me I was an Infp were true. 

So is this thing another hard pill to swallow? Just recently she says stuff like you like being like (blank some word that describes someone’s personality) today we were just talking about lucid dreaming which I have a lot and she said ‘that’s good because you like being in control’, every other friend says I’m not in the slightest controlling but then she says something so minor and it makes me feel like shit. Am I controlling? Because I never meant to be  and so many people tell me i go with the flow.

It’s such a small problem but anxiety just swallows me whole when I get thee slightest bit of criticism, even if she didn’t mean it that way, over the year since I’ve found out I’m an Infp I’ve learnt and grown so much tried to be myself tried to be honest tried to be available an ear for people going through it. But in all the madness you can expect someone to give you their honest view, even if they don’t mean it badly it’s not how I viewed myself and I don’t want to be controlling or anything that she’s called me the past week.

She has also told me many times that “I think you’ll be fine because I feel like you know yourself so well that you just know what you need”, aha I’m sorry but I’m a lost boat. I try my best to find my patterns understand what I need I try harder than most people because my whole life I’ve had to get out of things alone so yeah I know myself I’ve done a lot of work to but that doesn’t mean that I know how to help myself. ‘I went through my darkest times alone so don’t be surprised if I act like I don’t need anyone’, I said that a while ago and it’s slowly undoing itself. 

This sounds so selfish I’m not sure why but I just feel like so many things she says about me is un true. When I help her she asks me things, she tells me I’m the only one who helps her because I explain things she tells me I can understand and read people really well which I’m actually alright at doing. She comes to me and when she asks me to give her my honest opinion of her I do and she says that’s spot on but her of me is not accurate. Not just with the controlling thing multiple things. Is it just another hard pill to swallow.","Hey I can relate to some of that. I found out a year ago after I had had a stroke I was in and out of hospitals getting MRIS and blood tests. Had some down time and I took the test, after the test I read the description 100 times over and I just didn’t think that was me. I took the test 14 times more and every time it said I was an Infp, but I didn’t fit the bill. I hated myself for being that person they described, in actual fact the hard pill to swallow was realising that some people aren’t self aware. I pick myself up a lot of the time with anxiety and depression, I feel mostly extroverted, I’m more of an open book and I’m louder than INFP’s are described. But the image in my brain of who I am is not necessarily how I portray myself. I’ve since realised that I am an Infp. Maybe the fact that I was in and out of hospital wasn’t the best situation to be trying to understand the complexity of my personality. But I hated it too but trust me on this when you learn about it then learn about yourself and learn about the people around you it will click it will click unexpectedly and you won’t hate the MBTI you are.","My older brother M26 Infj and his wife F25 infp have been married for 3 years. I asked them once how they work. I am also an Infp and me and my older brother have been best friends forever, we haven’t really had an argument since I was 9. My brother told me for him as an infj that it was really hard to open up to someone, he wanted to be around someone he could talk to deeply but also have fun with. Someone who has similarities but is exciting. Infp has the same problem I guess with opening up and someone has to make the first move, I’m sure you two have already done that because it sounds pretty serious.

There is no key to eternal happiness there’s going to be problems along the way. They say love is blind because quite a few people get married quickly being blind to the complete lowest point anxiety can get to their partner. If you love them at their lowest you’ll love them no matter what. Security feeling sad trusted vulnerable when you’re that person for them and they’re that person for you. Aswell as when you can share laughs that’s when it will stick.","God yes my Ne is at an all time high when I’ve gotten barely 3 hours. My mind somehow finds links between things that people don’t usually see starts asking questions that I wouldn’t normally ask. Everything is so much more funny and my mind is running fast and I’ll speak very witty. Sporadic Enfp, everyone I know thinks I’m extroverted and everyone thinks I’m sporadic and they’re right I’m just always tired and I never speak the more well rested I am the calmer and quieter I am","Hey, F 18 here a lot of INFP’s that I know including myself are always interested in psychology, it’s our natural rebound. We like to make sure others are ok, we read other people quiet well and we are really good listeners. If you have the passion for it it’s really a good path for you to take if you’re interested in the inner workings of the mind. 

There’s also the unconventional options the 9-5 job option has never been my favoured path. Travelling seeing the world. Writing or art maybe while not guaranteed future with wealth, it’s a choice between money and happiness. Not saying that you can’t get money from that you definitely can it’s just a harder road. 

I work at Woolworths which is the Australian equivalent of Walmart in America. I am also a life guard at YMCA’s because I just love the water and I love the atmosphere. And sometimes at the beaches too. Then go to school for psychology and English, it’s what I love doing. I’m sure you’ll find your passions too I know it takes tons of time.

I forgot to add that it took ages to figure out what I was gonna do, had to stop giving a shit what everyone thought. Had to sit down, had to cry about it be completely lost for a while had to suffer and figure it out to find what I wanted to do with my life then I went for it.","Quarintine. We all have our complaints and we all want to get out of it I’m sure, some of us are already out. I’m a 16 yr old f from Australia we’ve been in quartile for what seems like forever. Guess the stereotype was that introverts are the only ones that will thrive in quarintine. I’ve always felt more ambiverted than picking on conventional side one side that’s supposed to define who I am and give me an explanation when I don’t fit the bill for introverted.

Although my socail battery does run out and I feel like everyone hates me like I’m a burden. Sometimes that makes me want to talk to everyone even more but then I feel ignored and I shut down. That’s not what I came to talk about though. I just have a question for other INFP’s, when you spend enough time inside without sunlight barely leaving ur bed does life seem real to you? It looks like I’m watching a hazy movie, I go outside and it’s like the visual affect is disfigured from my brain.

I feel so anxious and lonely so empty no motivation to do anything. I hate being controlled I’m sure like most teenagers do but as any INFP they don’t want to follow rules restrictions guidelines don’t want to be a conventional person. I’ve been told I’m not conventional I would never want to be, but staying at home all the time I have no option to see the world. 

The Covid rules here are that you’re only aloud outside for 1 hour a day and tbh most of the time I end up skipping it all together. I keep my blinds closed and do the same thing day in and day out. When I try do something different it doesn’t really make me happier I just wish I could see people. I don’t want to do anything, nothing that’s made me happy in the past is working for me now. Usually when I type out my feelings like I’m trying to do here and people read it I get compliments for how well I write I’m not a bad writer but today I can not write anything. 

It just sounds off to me everything that I’m typing my brain feels slow like it’s been injected with tons of rum. I don’t know what’s going on, I’m just so tired too.",Thing is I am attracted to him so can’t let him go. My fault for not telling him that though and I should’ve makes things clearer and less confusing and ‘messy’. I told him that I was interested and he was happy he asked me out too so win win. There’s more to the story too something went down elsewhere I’m just glad that I cleared my side up with him,"Hey thanks for that kinda helped. He’s still quiet but he’s talking now and I was really straight up told him exactly how I felt, he was happy about that. Cuz yeah I do like him romantically ngl just was always more of a hinter rather than someone who just came straight out and said it. So that’s what I did, turns out there’s more to the story than just me and he needs a minute so he’s still quiet which I get just glad that I did say that so he’s not hurt by me.","Snap, Instagram, YouTube, discord, house party, reddit, Pinterest, Facebook (for work) tik tok         Basically everything except twitter and tumblr","Hi INTJ’s I’m an infp and I have relationship problems. So I’ve been talking to this boy for 7 months now and because of Covid mostly over text. Every time I’ve been sad he has done his absaloute hardest to be there for me to make me smile to distract me, he’s gonna and stood up for me on more than one occasion when there’s been rumours spread around. I always felt like I never did anything for him despite the fact that he tells me I make him smile and he loves seeing me happy. 

We are both 16 so I’m not sure how much sense this is going to make and I’m fully aware that there are much bigger problems later on in life but I wouldn’t mind a little guidance especially because I messed something up. He’s always been sensitive and I know that his biggest fear is people not liking him, he told me he liked me about 5 months ago I hadn’t caught feelings yet and he knew that but he was ok. Then as time progressed he kept asking who my crush was, there are these things called yolos which are anonymous messages on Snapchat. 

I got a few of them and then I respond to them publicly the question I got was do you like anyone Rn. I said no and he got all sad and when I asked him what was wrong he said ‘don’t worry you obviously don’t feel the same way’, which for the record Rn is really not true. That was a month ago. I did another one of these story things last night and he hasn’t spoken to me since I posted them. I tried saying hi asking if he was ok and he said no I’m not I asked if I could help and I asked if I did something and he told me not to worry and that he didn’t want help.

I then asked if he wanted me to leave him alone and he said ‘yes’ then I didn’t respond I figured he needed space which I get. But if there’s anything I should know maybe about how he’s feeling or anything I can do because I hate that I hurt him and I wish I could make him smile but he doesn’t want to listen to me. Let me know",Honestly sometimes it’s hardest to tell the people closest to us the hard truth of what’s behind our reasoning. A lot of the time though the hardest thing to do is often the best thing for your mental health. Just because you don’t want other people to see you changing ( changing meaning being sad getting better) u want the before and the after but they’re scared of letting you see them change. It’s a tricky thing but honestly just starting the conversation being straight up but not harsh is best. But also have some laughs not every conversation has to be serious and in-depth.,"The way she describes her previous friend ships, where the other person is open and honest while she sits and is empathetic and helps. All INFP’s I guess have a tendency to want to sort things out on their own and yes sometimes that is what’s best so don’t force anything. But starting the conversation is always healthy, I was in a similar situation for 5 years I never told this person anything about myself I listened to them more than I did my own brain. In ending I stopped talking to them I learnt I grew and after a while I told them everything I finally got through to them after no one let me talk for 5 years. Starting the conversation slowly letting them feel safe Unjudged uninterrupted by other problems. That’s all it takes for the conversation to start good luck","Hi probably don’t even want a response but I thought why not. “ I feel like I’m not even good enough to be an INFP” no matter how trivial and irrational you see that line as being I agree, there’s this stereotype painted picture of hazy summer days with lakes rivers books and paint aswell as cozy rainy days by the fire staining out the window creating honest words and creative outlook on life. Atleast that’s what others seem to view it as, in reality I spend most of my time in complete anxiety not being able to navigate my way, having zero motivation to contribute to society in the bleak forced way that we have been pressured to by superiority for years. I don’t want a 9-5 job I don’t want to be normal I want to do things learn about the world. No matter how much I want that life I severely lack any motivation to do so. Then when I’m sick of pretending someone calls it out and I get anxious and sad and stop talking to people. Lonely unmotivated layers of anxiety and depression that you can’t get out from under. No clear path or beautiful landscapes to look at while your stuck just you and your image, the image you’ve been told is distant and wrong. I’m not sure if this makes sense but it does in my head. I guess people can tell me they love me but do they really or are they arrogant of what it would be like without me there. I get anxious feel like the world hates me then I get sad and the only thing that stops the anxiety attack is someone else’s voice, they sit there and compliment me like an alien being described it’s positive characteristics uninsightful of the negative. They only tell me that when I’m practically braking down infront of them which trust me I find very hard to do. But it’s more of a pitty out break of affection I don’t have words for this truthfully. There’s my rant, I really hope things get better for you, I wish life were like the vision in our heads but unfortunately for us it isn’t like that. It’s money and security which mean nothing to the people who value natural resources over a fake made up system.","Have you ever felt so lonely that you start going down a deep Internet hole. I have my standard basic things that I do every day I listen to the same genre of music the same shows but I’m very sporadic but I talk to similar people but then when I noticed myself getting bad getting anxious I start to go down deep Internet holes into unknown world Where I don’t have the answer to anything but it seems almost calming because in real life I can see the end of something and I don’t want the end to come because the end is uncertainty. 

And even though when I’m going down the deep Internet hole I’m just looking at things that don’t make sense to me philosophical and mental things and stuff that is beyond my capability to understand yet they calm me because I’m sitting there trying to learn and trying to understand but at the same time  I think about how much I don’t know about the world how much I want to know but I never have any motivation to learn it because as soon as I’m happy I lose that motivation and when I’m happy I’m not doing what I love I’m distracting myself from what I really want to do. 

I’m technically an introvert but I feel like I’m an extrovert most of the time I love talking to people 24/7 and I like going to parties and talking to people giving them hugs and listening to their days and I love doing that I love the people I surround myself with. But occasionally my social battery does drain out and there’s nothing I can do about that I crash because when I’m happy I have to give that happiness out to everyone and make sure that they’re okay before taking my own time away to focus on and recharge. 

I drain that socail battery and I feel like I’m a burden on people for talking to them all the time all I want to do is talk to them but at the same time all I want to do is shut up because I feel like they hate me because I feel like they don’t want me around all that I guess that they see me as someone who is trying to one up them in things that I say or they think I say too much or too little and I feel like no matter what no matter how much I search for a balance I will never find it because I don’t know about the world I don’t know what’s inside anyone else’s mind and I want to know I’ve always been interested in learning that but I feel so lonely.

So what the hell am I supposed to do I can’t look for answers because I can’t ask the people because I’m afraid of the answer and if I do ask and I do get an answer then what am I gonna do about it I’ve never taken action for anything. My last group of friends they threw me out I really grew from that I’m glad they threw me out I’m glad they got mad at me because I’m so much happier now but I don’t know what to do I’ve been pretending like I’m on a boat and I know where I’m going but the truth is I really don’t. I do most of the time until tonight until something so minor happens I spent ages thinking about it over analysing everything and even though the persons opinion really doesn’t matter to me it gets inside my head my anxiety gets in my head and takes over. 

Every time I go through stages of anxiety I listen to different music maybe or start doing something out of the ordinary but I don’t do things that are ordinary a lot like if you ask anyone that I know people always tell me I’m very sporadic they tell me that I don’t do what everyone else will do I am different or unique and I have been told that a lot today that I’m different and unique. I don’t see myself that way (unique) but that’s how I’ve been told that I am I’ve been told that I discuss the topics that no one else will and I’ll say the things that everyone wants to be said out loud but no one does because they’re afraid of the judgement.where as I stopped giving a shit because who I was pretending to be who they thought was me wasn’t me so what does it matter judgement.

I don’t mind being that person that’s who I am but every time that I get the smallest piece of criticism or i feel like someone hates me my anxiety gets in my head and takes control and  I’ll start listening to country music or I might go on runs or get the sudden urge to become a fitness addict. No matter what it is it’s never what I do every day its never what I think about all the time I start obsessing over something so ridiculous and small and becomes my existence and I focus on that until something takes over me and I have to sit there on the ground crying and not being able to breathe like an elephant sitting on my chest trying to figure out and sort out how to get out of this and I can’t see the end and I can’t get out from such a big weight. 

And then when I sit there on the ground crying and being to breathe and I’m lonely I just want to hear someone’s voice because I’ve been ignoring everyone around me I sit there and someone will text me by off chance which won’t have happened in awhile but when I’m sad someone will text me and asked me are you okay and I’m the sort of person who will honestly tell you if I’m ok or not. So I say no I’m not how are you and they won’t answer the question but instead they say what can I do for you they never say that they are never bothered to say what can I do for you or anything like that when I’m okay but I don’t mind that in the moment all I’m thinking about is trying to be able to breathe I say or you could do for me is sit here next to me and talk because that makes a huge difference just being able to hear somebody’s voice which is why confuses me when people say I’m introverted because I feel like people’s voices of the things that keeps me up every day and every night but in a good way.

So then I had this boy that I was kind of talking to a lot and I told him I just needed to hear someone’s voice I didn’t asked to hear his voice but then he sent me this really long audio message of him just talking about his day and honestly it’s got me to breathe I said I was able to breathe almost immediately but I don’t want to be dependent on somebody else. Because that person could go at any moment they can leave or I could push them away. I could drain out my social battery and start this whole lonely thing over again but they promised they wouldn’t leave but today they just haven’t been talking to me and they knew that I was sad. 

I don’t like routines or restrictions or being told what to do daily tasks and chores I’d rather paint the world and sketch it I’d rather read about the world discover people’s inner thoughts I’d rather do that then be bound by restrictions and rules but sometimes I do find myself doing things out of my ordinary personality I pretend to be something else no one really notices though, people actually think I’m happier when I’m doing that because they know me someone who likes not being the same all the time they know me aa someone who says and I quote ‘normal is boring’ so when I do something out of the ordinary people don’t take notice of it but all I want now while I’m anxious honestly is just to hear someone’s voice.

They say ignorance is bliss which is true because when I know something and someone gives me honest helpful criticism gets inside my head and it ruins mental state. My friends can tell me that they love me but do they really love me or are they just ignorant of what it would be like without me."
3GunGrace,"For the past couple of years I have always been a workaholic (working 2-3 jobs at a time) it kept me busy and kept my mind off of things. Being busy didn’t allow me to think about my life’s problems. 

Recently I accepted a promotion at my company. I went from working 3 jobs to 1. Now I have all this free time that I normally didn’t have. All this down time is really bringing back bad thoughts and I’m spiraling back into depression and thinking of suicidal thoughts. 

It’s making me regret the decision that I took the promotion. I was much happier working 3 jobs. Now I don’t know how to cope with this. I’m full of anxiety all the time. I try to be productive by going to the gym and engaging in hobbies but my bad thoughts still interrupt. 

I used work as an escape. It felt like I had some control in my life. It was my coping mechanism for my depression and now I feel completely lost and suicidal.",Ah shit I got all three. Pink bedazzled license plate on my lifted Tacoma and I wear eyelash extensions. Y’all on point 😂,"Hi all,
I recently just got promoted to a management position within my company. As grateful as I am, I need some advice. I’ve never in my life managed before. I will be overlooking pretty much the warehouse and production side of the company. The past couple of days I’ve been training in pretty much all aspects of warehouse and production operations. The idea of overlooking 40 employees on a single shift does terrify me a bit. Not only that but I’m a small young female so I know in general most of the male employees won’t take it so well that they’re boss is a girl. I guess my questions are, how do I be a good boss to my employees? Any other advice would be greatly appreciated.",What tires and wheels you running?,"
Did a solo roadtrip to Utah for a few days and hit up Zion, Bryce and Arches National park. Best decision ever. Now off to Colorado for my next adventure 🌲⛰👞","I’ve actually just done this route a few days ago. Did Zion, Bryce and Arches. Currently on my way to Aspen, Colorado. 

There is a lot of good advice on here already but definitely look ahead and purchase the shuttle bus tickets for Zion the day before at 9:00AM on the dot. They do sell out quickly! 

Another tip: when you buy the pass to get into the national parks they’re good for 7 days. Keep them if you plan to return or decide to pass through the park. I was staying over at the Zion ponderosa ranch which is on the east side of Zion. I had to get back to town (which requires me to go through Zion) to meet up with a friend and I was an idiot and threw my receipt away, so I had to pay another $35 to enter.

In addition I work part time for a body armor manufacturer working in R&D but I’m also cross trained in different departments so I have a variety of different roles within the company. This job I thoroughly enjoy because the company itself supports all first responders law enforcement, EMS,firefighters, etc. and I have the opportunity to work alongside them.

It's getting harder to pretend that I'm fine and I'm scare that if I explode nothing good is going to came out of it.","No problem, thanks yo you I discovered a new amazing subreddit about cats","As a white person I can tell you that if the atrocities had stop 200 years ago I'll say you are right but sadly The Civil Rights act was signed on 1964 and the right to vote was given a year later that's just 55 years ago.

Nelson Mandela was released form prisión in 1990 (30 years ago)

Nowadays there is still people going around whit confederate flags and Nazi parafernalia. 

Obviously even while slavery is not an issue any more for black people nowadays there still enough racism going around toward them that if they are ""racist"" against white people (which they are not) it is clearly a defense mecanims and not actual racism.","I agree with you in this statement, but reading the comments I'm not sure you are saying what I though you were saying.

I know for sure that Black people can be racist (over other minorities such as Asians) but I definitely wouldn't count white people to be one of these minorities. 

I think that what you are describing as racism towards white people is more a total lack of faith towards them which is totally justified.","Thanks, I have 4 cats but she is the noisier. No doubt.","Not really, she just want attention. She has been fixed since this video and I truly believe that she still goes under some kind of psicological heat and goes crazy for attention from time to time.",Is actually one of these rubber bracelets. Since they are elastic you can use it as cat collar when they are still kittens.,"It is. She does have a exact replica of Batman mask on her face. And yes, is a female, I rescued her (and her siblings) from the street when she was 2 days old and I named her thinking she was a boy.","I live in Spain and work in Gibraltar (UK) we are more than 10k frontier workers crossing that border every day.

Is actually really common here were I live, is quite simple.

My commute time is usually les than an hour depending on traffic and that's because I don't live in the city right beside Gibraltar, you can have as short as 10 minutes commute there.","I'm not sure why should you become an Autonomo.

 I'm a frontier worker, I live in Spain and work in Gibraltar and I'm certainly not an Autonomo.

You will have to present a tax return in Spain if you will be living here but you can probably have the same regime as a frontier worker.

I pay taxes in Gibraltar (I have to present a Tax return there) and I pay the difference here in Spain.

Let's say that for the work I do I should pay in Spain 20% tax if what I pay in Gibraltar is less than that (which it is) I have to pay the difference.

Check it out because you can probably do it that way which is cheaper.","I think that PCR+ means positive. Maybe it does not check with the daily Spanish report because Spaint count all positive tests not just PCR.  


PCR is the best test to check if someone is contagious but there is other test that also check if you are COVID positive and at the beginning there was not so mas PRC done in Spain that why the positive total and PCR positive totals are different numbers.",Most people in Spain are against it if they took an official vote most people would be surprised of the results. I honestly don't know how there is still people going to the bullfights.,I'm frontier worker and every time that I need to buy flowers I buy them at morrisons (in Gibraltar) it is crazy expensive to buy flowers in Spain and supermarkets don't sell them the only similar thing that you could try is to send a whole flower plant from Carrefour or Leroy Merlin and it would still be crazy expensive.,"Most of the time everybody pay cash in restaurants and bars so they usually don't bring the card reader if you ask for the check.

Also most people here, unless it is a family , is used split the account so they usually leave the check so you can check it and calculate your share and you can call them back to pay, that's why they don't go directly to your table with the reading card.","La salud publica en España está muy bien pero para urgencias reales (accidentes o similares)   
 Si tienes cualquier problema que requiera la visita a un especialista (por ejemplo ejemplo, te duele la espalda) para cuando te den cita lo mas provable es que ya no te duela.

Si quieres tener una alternativa para este tipo de casos en los que necesitas que te vea un Especilista de forma urgente te recomiendo un seguro privado.

Pero no te compliques con los seguros de mas de 20€ que incluyen hospitalizacion o cosas así por que eso te lo cubre bien la sanida publica. 

Yo personalmente tengo un seguro privado pero tengo uno básico con copago es decir, pagas una cuota (que suele estar entre los 12 y los 25 euros) y si necesitas ir a un especialista pagas un precio reducido de lo que cuesta la consulta (por ejemplo, Si cuesta 70€ pagas unos 15€) a menos que seas un hicopondriaco y te pases el día en el medico esto es lo que resulta mas cómodo y económico.

Yo hace un año que tengo el seguro privado y aun no lo he usado.","My mom's boyfriend works as personal tourist guide in Andalucía mostly for German people (since he is German) and he has a really interesting way of showing off Andalucia because he present it as we ourselves live it not as a Turist would see it.

Most of his clients love the experience and they learn so much about our culture and history because he knows all little details and anecdotes of history and the places that he visit with them.

It is always funny we he tell us about his clients and the kind of questions that they ask and how the get really surprised whit the answers. Sorry I can not remember any specific question that they asked.","Pan rallado is breadcrumbs so is not the same, here in Spain gluten free breadcrumbs is usually made with corn breadcrumbs you could check there if the gluten free breadcrumbs is made of corn bread so you could use that.","Usually wen you have some Preposition or article in your name it is written in lower case but You can write it however you like since is your name.  


Abut the second question you can check yourself here:  [https://www.ine.es/widgets/nombApell/index.shtml](https://www.ine.es/widgets/nombApell/index.shtml)  


This is the official Statistic Institute web page, you can write your name an surname and check how many people have de same name and where in Spain.",Por esa regla de tres podemos recuperar el espíritu de la ~~Mezquita~~ Catedral de Cordoba y que vuelva a ser un templo Musulmán.,Ya iba siendo hora.,"I didn't explain myself properly, Can you legally give away the paternity of your unborn child having the mother's consent?","But if you give the child away for adoption you don't need to pay child support, so it does not make sens to me why can't someone just give away their paternity from the beginning.","Just another risky career such as police or firefighter but easier to get in. 

At least this is how I see it and most people that I know think the same. 

(Spain btw)","It was like that in Spain not long ago but now is mandatory to wear a mask at all times when you are walking around.

Even at the beach, you have to wear it to walk at the beach unless you are on your way to the water of coming back from the water, but if you are going from your car to the sand, or just having a walk by the shore you have to wear it.

This was imposed because people were not keeping social distance while not wearing masks so the only way to prevent COVID was to make mask mandatory at all times.","It's been 2 months since Spain opened the Bars and restaurants and I can proudly say that I have not step a foot in one since February. 

I have meet with my family but just in small groups of 5 persons top for lunch or dinner in their places or mine. There is just 13 people that I have being with without using a mask at different moments since June.

Most people respect my decision to be ""paranoid"" but safe. Even if most of them do whatever they want at any point trying to avoid the safety rules.

Maybe you should try to explain to them how you are feeling try to make them understand that even if they feel safe you don´t and therefore that you will gladly see them on your own terms and following some security measurements. 

You could maybe do a research and present them with an alternative plan that you would be confortable with.

I they keep being AH about your concerns you can always stay home and meet the later on your terms.","Omg, I totally love Daryl but I have to say that literally 5 minutes ago I was just telling a friend how I loved the idea of Daryl and Jesus, I have to say that I'm a big shipper.

Intelligent-Plastic3,"I do all my schoolwork just to do it and put only enough effort in to pass, I tried to get into a relationship but turns out she didn’t see it going anywhere from the start and just led me on for several months, thought I could play video games and stream but the lack of views made me just want to quit, I told a friend how I was feeling and how being so isolated and alone was the main cause of it so she suggested that being alone was what I needed. Even though I said I’d contemplated whether death was or wasn’t better than how I’m living right now she still suggested I continue to be isolated. At this point nothing feels right and I feel like giving up on everything. All I’ve wanted for the past 9 months of quarantine was to see someone and feel loved and cared for, I have yet to find that in anyone. I’ve spent a total of 9 hours with friends since quarantine started because all of them are introverts and are fine alone. Even at this moment the only thing I want to do is get a real hug from someone and actually be able to lean on them so I can let good everything weighing me down. Instead my family wants me to get a job on top of the 8 classes I have, none of my friends want to hang out, and my only escape in the form of video games is becoming less and less effective by the minute.","Well yeah, it’s a jetpack not a rocket pack","It’s got an ISP of 7,845 XD and uses so little fuel that it says “0.0kg/s” for fuel usage.

Both don’t need to be at the actual center of the plane but for a VTOL takeoff you need them to be right on top of each other.

Isnotallthere,"Normally if you see that your closing yourself off from your loved ones you talk to someone about it. Not me. I can't.

There are so many little things that have piled into this major ball of ending it all. The only reason I haven't? I'm afraid of dying.

Yup. I'm afraid of living but I'm also afraid of dying. 

I'm afraid if I actually go through with it I will regret it, but that if I don't do it I will just be a waste of human life. 

I can't say I have horrible parents, because I would be a liar if I said that and mom and dad didn't raise a liar. They raised a child with a guilty conscious.

But I still haven't said all those minor things that urge me. So here they are:

1. My parents are slightly homophobic and I happen to be transgender. (I want to transition)

2. I over think A LOT. 

3. I'm always paranoid something bad will happen.

4. I constantly think I'm not good enough.

5. I have a really toxic and abusive relationship with my Older sister. 

6. I've struggled with ED and at one point I did win but slowly fell back into the hole I dug out of.

7. If something changes too much I become overwhelmed.

See I told you small minor things. Things everyone overlooks. So let's break them down.

Yes, I want to transition (FtM), but I know how my parents will feel at being told this. Yes they are very supportive and I love them to death but being part of the LGBTQ+ Community is not something that they support full heartedly. 

I overthink everything, most people see a stranger, I see a violent person awaiting to get me alone. You see a cashier, I see someone holding a gun. It's not easily something to just ignore.

Ah yes paranoia. This shit is why I am who I am. You see this wooded area at night. Well shit, I see a dark place with no escape. One in which I can easily become prey. I often tend to hear voices, they are voices I have never heard before.

Okay so back story on this one. My older sister always told me I wasn't good enough and of course I believed her. My dumb ass. So whenever someone told me I did something wrong I would replay the words, ""Your not good enough"" in my head in their voice.

We've all heard of sisterly love or brotherly love? Well this goes beyond that. My sister has Fucked me up so much that I don't know what love is. We both have anger problems, but hers have always been uncontrollable while mine were normally rare but big bursts of rage hers were frequent but violent bursts. I had to deal with several beatings. And when I say beatings I mean, I've been thrown to the floor, spat on, punched, kicked, bitten, smacked, hit with objects, pinned to the ground, stepped on, pushed off of things, stabbed with things like pencils, and even almost sent to the hospital with broken limbs, cracked ribs, brain damage and almost killed on several occasions. And I know how bad it sounds. Shit I fucking lived it. I would go to school wearing cardigans and long pants because I would often have bruises all over my body. A couple on my face which were easily covered with makeup. My sister has verbally abused me as well, telling me to kill myself (which is now illegal), and calling me names (which is not always a form of abuse). Now I could sum this all up with one word. Bully. My sister has always been a bully. She's gotten suspended for it. And when she does it to someone once they freak the fuck out and everyone rushes to their side as I silently treat my wounds pretend like nothing has happened. I have been a silent victim for who knows how long. My sister has despised me for being babied by my parents and even being skinny, which was a result of my ED. I have suffered in silence for roughly 11 years. She's been doing this shit since I was around 4. She used to be my hero and would save me from anything but quickly became the one thing she promised she would never be, the villain. 

Now ED is something I know I can overcome but when you are constantly told to, ""Stop eating so much"" and then when you do your told to, ""Eat a burger"" it du2cks with you. You can easily get Fucked up from it. I have been fat shamed and skinny shamed so don't say I don't know what it's like, I do, and it is painful. I've been told I have a disgusting body when I have worn a dress or even a oversized hoodie and some long leggings. I've also been told I have an amazing body by several people, which I find it to be degrading as well since I have always hated my body and never thought it belonged to me.

Finally the last one. Now don't change your mind, please for fucks sake dont. I have a bad relationship with change. When I was in the 1st grade I always had a new teacher, no biggy right? WRONG. This caused me to act up frequently and have random bursts of anger. Something not common with me normally. Since I can control my anger unless you get me fucking pissed. I have also hated change because I lost my biological father to a divorce (change). He changed into an angry person and ended up leaving for a new bitch and the fucking military after he said and I quote, ""I wasn't ready to be a father"" which I wanted to say so fucking bad, ""Once you figured it out you could have came back."" 

Now. I have cut myself, no I don't need the suicide help hotline number, I've got that down to a science. Which I guess is both good and bad. It tells you how often I look up help methods but never actually use them. I'm afraid to tell anyone openly without being through a screen but I don't want or need help so please don't try to shove it on me. I just wanted to explain what's going through my mind. I guess thanks for reading?","For as long as I can remember I have always been terrified of loud noises. 

I can't pin point when it first started to be exact but I know it developed when I was younger. I had always been frightened by sudden loud noises or even noises I knew would occur.

It began with hearing cars swerve or roller coasters moving. But escalated to many different things becoming a trigger.

The first time I noticed it when I got older was when my sister or mom would sweep the carpet, my heart would begin racing as I would jump to the couch and cover my ears afraid that the noise alone would kill me if it got to me. 

Because of this I was often teased by my Older sister who would purposely cause loud noises near me. The only way I found to escape the panic would be to play loud music in my headphones, I never knew why I wasn't scared  of the music. But I'm happy I'm not. 

But even when the noise would stop I would be shaking. When I mowed the lawn and swept I would often feel a rush of panic and I tried to get out of the situation so I didn't have to go through it all over again. 

Just last night I was making a strawberry banana smoothie in the blender and before I even plugged the blender in I kept checking to make sure it was off. I wanted to try pushing myself to indure the noise for however long it took but I couldn't. 

The rush of panic overwhelmed me and I felt like crying. It was as if my entire body was ready to give up the second it heard the blender.

I caved into my headphone usage and put them on. I hate how easily this can get to me but I've always thought I had sensitive ears. But I honestly think it's just me.

Another time I noticed an extreme situation was when I was told to start the engine of a car. I began to feel off, my hands were shaking and I didn't want to do it at all.

When I finally got it on after fumbling for a little I had tears in my eyes and my hand was violently shaking. It looked like I had indured something traumatic. 

Fireworks,  roller coasters, and cars swerving seem to be the only loud noises I can handle anymore.

Even the sound of someone hammering something sends shivers down my body and my hands begin to shake, this normally causes me to begin gasping for air.

As someone who is normally hands-on and as always wanted to be a welder I see where I could possibly be putting myself in a rough situation as if I get set off by anything I become breathless as I gasp for air, my hands began to shake.

I become more jumpy than usual, and it can be quite dangerous for me to panic if I'm in a construction zone.

I'm only 15 so I have about 3 to 5 years until I begin welding. But if I take a construction class I am setting myself up for constant panic attacks, which I have now. 

I often get told I'm faking it and that I need to just, ""suck it up"" and ""deal with it"". However when I try to explain anymore they often shush me. My dad has never believed me because I have experienced many loud noises and they didn't ""effect"" me.

Which I try to explain to him that they did, and I have no idea how he hasn't seen it. I've been called an overthinker because I begin to play out all the disastrous possiblilities these loud noises could do to me.

And yes, I am afraid of loud thunder. Loud booms can send me in a full panic which normally ends with me drenched in sweat. 

But school is even worse when I'm attending. The constant fire drills have sent me into a silent panic, one where I begin to breathe heavily, my heart begins to race, I become pale, and my hands will shake.

But music isn't my only coping method, It is the only coping method I know that does not happen randomly. Randomly if I think or I hear a loud noise I begin to make small or even high pitched noises as a way to block it out. 

It's something that I cannot control and it starts as an urge, I don't suppress it because I physically can't. It has happened a couple times at school which have not helped but thankfully I was able to muffle the noise with my hand. 

Most people are understanding but there are a few that find it absurd that a phobia can effect me this much. I know it is probably not as bad as other people's but it is the worst phobia I have.","My sister got me a lamp and told me, ""It's brighter than your future.""

But y'all are gonna need some background. I live in Indiana. I was in Fort Wayne Community schools I'll give you that much. Well it was terrible. I took Spanish 1 and 2 in middle school there. However that's where the issue starts. I go through those classes and end up moving right before highschool. I live into a completely different district and retake Spanish 2 freshman year. I go through it unhappily, and end up passing with a B. Well I head into Spanish 3 and now it's two weeks into the year and I'm already failing. I have an F (55%). I am sooo far behind and cannot seem to catch up! I tried duolingo, and even Rosetta stone, I cannot afford a tutor or have much time for one since I'm always on my feet moving around. I need a foreign language for my academic honors, and I could change to German and take German 1 and 2 since I really want to study German.

This would still give me academic honors by changing.

Well I better get used to this dating game,Is there anyway I could spin this to offer a friendship? I really did like spending time with her platonically and I would hate to lose a connection like that.,So you're saying that maybe she did have a good time... but wouldn't be interested in a 2nd date? Honestly im not hurt that she wouldnt be interested. Im hurt because she ghosted me. Why couldnt she just tell me that she wasnt feeling it? Isn't that the mature thing to do?,Then why even say they had a good time on the date? It bugs me so much that I dont know why she ghosted me,"Damn, well that sucks. How do I avoid this in the future?",I can understand ghosting. But why say the date went well and agree to a 2nd date? It just seems weird no? Or do people just ghost out of no where?,"This is just a complicated way to say ""ya basic""",Then why does she get so angry and lash out? It just makes me feel like I'm in the wrong,"Already done, she's blocked from everything. She came to me when she was stressed out or didn't know how to be happy and asked me. Thankfully she never talked about her boyfriend with me. Just comments about him.",I know this sounds stupid. But she found someone and she's happy. I just feel like I have to put myself out there and be happy too. You know?,"Thank you, this made me feel a lot better. I'm starting to think I should just be single and enjoy the friends I have.","Blocked her on everything and I'm trying to focus on the future. I'm not talking to her or even looking her up.

I kept questioning her and asking her if she meant it. And she said she meant it with all her heart. Like what?","Oh yeah, I kept telling her I didnt care that she dumped me (honestly I dont). She just didn't have to be a jerk through the whole process.","I'm not planning on seeing her again, and I mean it. This wasn't some post to lament about my ex and hope that I get back with her again. She caused me a fuck ton of pain and doesn't deserve to be in my life. I dont even want to be within 10 feet of her. The sheer selfishness she must have to think that she has a right to be my friend or even come to me when she needs to supported is beyond me.","I've kinda turned into a fuckboy of sorts and been having lots of sex with multiple woman that are leagues better. But I dont think it's working. I know this sounds whiney, but even with other women I still think of the pain she caused me. Sex is definitely not the asnwer","The thing is, I've dated her for 4 years and never saw this side to her. She was very compassionate and there for me during my rough times. It's difficult to imagine she was like this the whole time.",Yeah I blocked her on everything. I don't like the person she became.,"Yeah, I thought she was manipulating me too. I just don't get it because she has a boyfriend. Why does she need me in her life?","I did block her, and that was exactly what I was thinking.

gblackout700,"I am lost and could go. To sum things up. My life was going great up untill 2016. When I was 22 years of age. At that time my girlfriend and I were together a total of six years so far. I would like to leave out details because I tend to get uncomfortable flash backs and would like to avoid them. But she passed away in early 2017. After this I went down hill, completely down hill like no other. I am lost, miserable, depressed, and do not know how much longer I can go on. I am not posting this to make you feel sympathetic towards me. I post this because I do not know what to do. I see a Pysch. And a counselor monthly and it has yet to help. I have not been happy since she has passed. I don’t feel alive inside and to sum it up, I am a complete wreck and lost. There is much more but I’d like to get it brief because it is embarrassing. I would like to assume I am a strong individual but I literally have been broken down and do not know if I can ever get back up. I miss her and love her so much and other events due to her passing have made it worse as well. So please if anybody has took the time to read this, I am begging........ what do I do?",They say but did it actually,"I filed my PUA in OHIO on 7/14. I have been laid off since 2/17. I tried the regular unemployment first which took a month or so to deny me because I work for tips, and then I didn’t know I was eligible for PUA u till July. So then I filed a PUA claim on 7/14. I have been doing the claims and the only issue I have left is my  Identity Verification process. I submitted my taxes and ID twice. It has been 8 weeks. I already know they have to manually go into every account and look at the I’d/ whatever document you submitted to verify your identity and that they are backed up. I have called PUA 22 times. They have escalated it 5 times, I was told a supervisor was gonna call me back 4 times, and they have looked over my account and said everything is fine, and they keep telling me to wait. I have had people that filed after me get there IDentity verified before mine. It’s been 8 weeks and all they keep telling me is to wait, what do I do?

Second issue:
I was laid off work 2/17. When I filed my claim I didn’t know I could back date but then around 7/22 I filed my back date. I am still waiting on my Identity to get verified but would like to get the claims for back date moving along. So I called up and the call center sent two emails for back pay for me. I did not hear anything, than I was told after calling for the 19th time that i was suppose to send an email myself. I finally sent an email my self on 8/15 to PUA-technical-services@ blah blah, and that might be exact email address but I did send it to the write one I just don’t have it in front of me. Anyways, I have yet to hear about my back date, and I had people after me get there’s approved too. I have exhausted all my savings and borrowed as much as I can already. 

So to sum it up, been waiting 8 weeks for identity verification and back date. What should I do and I need help please :(",Anybody know where I can buy k2 paper or spray ?

He was really upset because I came off like I was ignoring him and I acknowledged my mistakes and apologized, but because of school there wasn't much I could change (Btw our relationship wasn't a friendship nor was it an actual relationship, if that explains his behavior a bit. We just wanted to wait a lil but we both liked each other a lot). When I tried to call him while I worked on homework he would leave me alone because he didn't wanna distract me (even when I made it clear he didn't). He wouldn't answer my texts and basically wouldn't talk to me unless I called him at night first. He said in the beginning that he was the type of person to put a lot of time into people and it better help me understand why he felt the way he did when I didn't talked to him enough, but I feel like he was kinda upset with me no matter what. Every time we called we would try to talk things out but it never really got anywhere. Whenever I asked him what he wanted me to do to fix things he couldn't give me an answer. Eventually he stopped answering my calls, and I just said that I'm tired and he can decide to text me if he ever wants to talk again, news flash: he hasn't texted back.

She's actually 16 yo. Whenever I try asking her problem she keeps saying that I won't understand like our parents. 

And I can't understand them really. They once saw my sis harm herself by slapping herself really hard multiple times while crying. I think she was mad about something can't really remember. 
First they comforted her saying ""we'll be there"" yada yada. Then afterwards my mum told her that if she does it again she'll slap her. I was so shocked I couldn't even say anything. 

And, oh, our school's councelor is really shitty. I tried her one time and she made me feel even worse. I'm not taking my lil sis in that hell hole that will make her feel much worse.

I tried making my parents understand for my lil sis' sake, but they still couldn't. I think it's because they grew up mentally strong?

I thought they FINALLY understood my dilemmas. But no. After that it's like they never heard my problems at all. Again, I unintentionally harmed myself due to stress and my mum saw it and warned me that if I do it again she'll slap me. It really hurt me since I can't control it.

I try to meet people online but usually the only people who like me are more interested in confident people or never want to spend actual time together, they want to hang out like once a week or less and I get that were just starting to know each other but it takes about a month of anxiety filled dating where I try to convince myself this one will work just to see them like 4 times all for it to end with me feeling like I did everything wrong and feeling more and more lonely.

My health is spiraling fast and I feel powerless to stop it. I'm afraid to lie down and go to sleep because I wake up after a few hours and my limbs are completely numb. Sometimes I wake up and my muscles and veins are ""burning."" Sometimes even my chest hurts. I know I need to see a doctor but I have no health insurance.

In looking at this problem, I realize it probably wants me to get to the inverse trig function since it looks just like arctan. Except none of what I've tried is helping me simplify this problem. I let u = (1+ln(5s)) and got 1/s which I figured would help me cancel out the 8s, that way I'm left with only 1/u\^2 as the integrand. Except that didn't help me at all.

The way my teacher explained lists, ""happy"" should be the first item in that list (so \[0\]) whereas 2, 0,1, and 5 are the second, third, forth and fifth. Yet when I try to print them I'm getting some weirdness. For instance, if I type print(n\_list\[0\]\[0\]) it will only print the h of happy.

In this example, we were given specific values for what the integral of 0 to 4 of x^(3) equals. In this case it equals 64, which is easy enough. But I am not sure why 4 \* integral results in 4\*4.

I plugged in the limit to get the indeterminate form 1^(∞) .

Alright, so I need to turn it into a fraction. L=lim x →  ∞   -5xln(1+7.5/x)

Brought the x down to the denominator by changing it to x^(-1). Applied the limit again and I thought it gave me an indeterminate form which would allow me to apply L'Hopital's Rule.

Got 37.5/x(x+7.5) over -1/x^(2) Applied the limit and got some nonsense answer that was wrong. Apparently the correct answer is 5.1755 \* 10^(-17)

I've never had any medical problems in the past except for digestive issues when I was younger (frequent constipation as a child). I don't smoke, don't drink, don't use any medications except the occasional aspirin when I have a headache (which might be 2-3 times a year). 

I came down with pneumonia January of 2019 and recovered with the help of antibiotics. From March of 2019 to June of 2020 I wasn't experiencing any health issues or symptoms, until a week after I got blood drawn for lab work. The lab test indicated slightly higher hemoglobin count and high iron. The doctor had me do more bloodwork two weeks later to check my iron levels again and according to him those came back normal/better than the first. 

In late July I started waking up to my hands completely numb, and sometimes even my arms and feet. At first I assumed it was because I had my arms in awkward/bent positions but then I woke up one morning and noticed my arms were completely unbent. I was sleeping on my back with both hands resting on my stomach, and my hands were completely numb. When I started moving them again I could feel the blood pouring into them. Late July is also when I first heard my pulse in my left ear.

This happens maybe twice a week, only at night. Once I woke up and had a cramp in one calf in addition to completely numb hands. Whenever this happens I usually get stressed out and find it impossible to go back to sleep. I also started getting forearm pain in late September, as well finger pain whenever I grip with my fingers. Also, the pulsatile tinnitus is now happening with increased frequency, to the point where I can hear the whooshing sound perhaps 5-10 times a day. 

I've always been a semi-active person. I occasionally have periods where I'll go a month without working out but for the most part I am pretty good at being consistent. I go on 30 minute runs five times a week and hour long bike rides once a week. When I get back from my runs, my hands will sometimes be redder than normal/blue. I also sometimes get a ""ear infection"" feeling in either ear, where there is slight pressure/discomfort in one or the other. 

Another thing that has been bothering me is my neck. It never feels ""normal,"" it always feels somewhat sore. I'm no longer able to swivel or turn my head as quickly as I used to be able to, and because I don't want to tweak it or make it worse I have stopped weightlifting entirely. This might be unrelated or nothing but when I shower and lean down to massage the shampoo into my scalp, there are times where it feels like the blood stays pooled in my head for 20+ minutes. Sure that sensation always happens whenever I lean down in the shower but it used to go away in less than a minute. 

Any contribution whether from a medical professional or someone who thinks they might know what's going on, I extend my gratitude. Yes I'm planning on seeing a doctor, I am just trying to wait until open enrollment for insurance.","In that case this is solved, thanks for the help with understanding this.","I now see quite clearly where you got the 0.5^(x)x from, but how do you take the derivative of that? Would it be two product rules? I had thought of bringing the x down in front of the natural log but at the time I didn't think it would help me solve it at all.","&#x200B;

I know this is the product rule, and what you see in the white box is indeed the correct answer. My question is, how does taking the derivative of log\_9(3^(x)) result in 1/2?

When I took the derivative it seemed to cancel. 3^(x)ln(9) over 3^(x)ln(9)","The prof noticed I was entering the wrong answer, finally acquiesced and told me I should've gotten -sin^(2)(θ)/275, and that I should plug into theta the value I get from tan^(-1)(275/268) 

I suppose my only question now is where did she get the -sin2(θ)/275 from. 

Thanks for trying to help me, sorry for being so dense lol.","The terminology ""with respect to x"" is new to me. Is that similar to tan(θ) of x? Or x of tan(θ). Or could I use another variable in place of  θ since implicit derivation usually means there is the variable y somewhere in the equation. tan(y)=275/x

In that case the derivative would be -275/x^(2)sec^(2)(y). Sorry that I'm so confused but thank you for your patience.","Looks like the derivative would be tan(θ) = -275/x2 which matches with the (275^(2) \+ x^(2)) you gave me. Or did I get the wrong derivative, since I feel like I need to do something with the tan(θ)?",x=275/tan(θ). Is that what you're asking for? In terms of the hypotenuse I believe it would be  sin = 275/hypotenuse. I suppose you could use the Pythagorean theorem to get  383.99 for the hypotenuse.,"&#x200B;

I asked the professor and the only advice she gave is 275/268 = tan**θ** but where to go after that is pretty much lost on me. Does anyone know what to do with the information she gave me?","Ah okay, that does make sense. After reading your reply and the reply from the other poster, I see that I should get dy/dx = (5(f(x))^(4) \* f'(x)) which is just what you gave me.

Then, plugging in the known value for f'(x) should give me 4/25 = f(x)^(4)  which I can solve by just taking a fourth root. Sorry for the late response but I do appreciate the help. I suppose I need to focus on finding out what a question is asking, and determining the key pieces before considering everything else.","Ah okay, that does make sense.

Even with the hint I'm still at a loss as far as how to solve this or where to begin. Information overload, and I don't know where or how the pieces fit together. Can anyone point me in the right direction?"

My quails seem to either be not eating, or eating a lot less than they used to. Should I wait and see if they will start eating the dry pellets?

kookiesfb,"Back in November of last year, after years of struggling through many years of verbal and physical abuse from family and peers, suffering through my own suicidal thoughts and actions I finally almost took my own life. The scars are still yet to heal, I was told that if not for the person that rushed to call the hospital after I told them I would be going to sleep after a long depressive rant filled with anger and tears I would have died. As I recovered and was given a diagnosis of severe anxiety and depression along with medication to help I felt as if life would be a bit better for me. Gradually things started to go my way, I have a beautiful girlfriend, a great job with amazing coworkers and all the things I've wanted to own... and yet I feel empty, dont get me wrong I do cherish these things and I dont want to let any of them go, however, I still feel an intense desire to end it all. I spend many sleepless nights staring at the ceiling contemplating my own death. The past few weeks have been especially hard as my mother and father have separated, my girlfriend has started drinking, and I've began speaking to less and less people. At this point is it even worth it anymore? Even when I'm taking my meds I dont feel a difference, I dont feel any better. What should I do?

I personally think that's all more important than getting kills with a bomb.

Typically I dont just toss my ultimate because it actually has quite a lot of utility, you can use it to get back into mech if you get focused down or you can use it to force an enemy team to sacrifice space (especially if you throw it past an orisa shield after she places it). If I do throw my ultimate I'll try to combo with my main tank (shatter, pull, ect.) or I'll use it on an engage to allow for my team to play more aggressive and maybe get a pick with the bomb myself. You can also do some cool tricks with a Dva bomb like throwing it into a wall and forcing it to slide or pushing it off a ledge.

Exciting about your upcoming appt, what’s the tat if you’re cool sharing?",Aw thanks!,"Thank you! This was my first kinda more abstract-ish(?) design I’ve tried. Now that I’m figuring out better poke techniques, I’m slowly starting to get cleaner and more solid lines and, boy, is it fun.","YES. I’ve wanted this tat since I first saw that episode, I love it so much. I’ve been too scared to do it on myself since it’s such a curly, curvy, twisty design—super impressive you were able to do it!","Rainbow Chinese Restaurant on ~28th(?) and Nicollet is sooo tasty. It’s on the more expensive side (entree is somewhere between $15-20 or so) but it’s worth it when you want to treat yo self. 
Try the turnip cakes—sounds gross(or it did to me, at least) but they are delicious. Also: chocolate cream cheese wontons for dessert! They started doing delivery, but the delivery fee is like $15 and the range isn’t huge so it’s worth it to just go pick food up.  

Sakura, in Downtown St. Paul is one of my favorites too. They recently pared down their menu so there aren’t as many vegetarian options which is a bummer for me, but the quality of food has always been top notch and I’m guessing it’ll be even better now that they are doing a smaller, more focused menu. 
Tempura vegetables are done perfectly, and they even have tempura fried ice cream, though I’m not sure if they are doing that for takeout. If I remember right, they’ve got sushi rolls named after Wild players since they are right next to Excel, if that does anything for ya. Everyone who works there is really nice, too. 

Also, Victor’s Cuban Cafe on 38th and Grand in S Minneapolis is one of the best spots in town for breakfast. It’s not cheap, but it’s reasonably priced for the quality. They’ve got a big menu with options for everyone from adventurous eaters to folks with strict dietary restrictions. They do lunch(and dinner, I think?) too, but I always order from the breakfast menu. Mango pancakes, eggs/beans/rice with creole sauce, fried plantains, etc. Everything I’ve ever eaten there has been delicious but for me, nothing will ever top the fried yucca with mojo sauce 🤤","I got some Mom’s ink and it seems to work better and pools less than my Kuro Sumi, for whatever reason. Might just be that I adjusted my overall technique.  I’ll have to go back and try it out again now that things are going better but, fwiw, I like Mom’s for now.","Got some hustle butter and I do like it better than Vaseline! It feels thinner and doesn’t feel like it clogs(?) up my needle as much. It’s really nice for aftercare, too. Plus since a tiny amount goes such a long way, the small jar I got for like $7 will last a looong time. 
And yes(!) on the going slow and doing as many pokes as possible on each pass. Learning is fun!"

On a practical  note, can you make it mandatory for your students to turn on their cameras and mics during your classes and encourage them to ask questions? Maybe they are getting negative vibes from you and they are either disinterested (due to your own low mood which could be affecting how you come across to your students) or scared/intimidated and don't want to speak up. I'm just hazarding a guess here.

Do speak to a therapist if you can. Alternately, is there another trusted teacher you can talk to? Maybe they might be having similar experiences?

Previously, I always added water to the pellets but now that the weather is getting warmer (I'm in the southern hemisphere so we're getting close to summer), I had to stop wetting the pellets because the food was starting to spoil after a few hours.

My quails seem to either be not eating, or eating a lot less than they used to. Should I wait and see if they will start eating the dry pellets? I'm not sure if they are having trouble swallowing the pellets, they are just standard game bird pellets and should be small enough for them to swallow. Do you think it would help if I ground the pellets into a powder? I used to do that when they were chicks but now they are 6 months old and I think they should be able to swallow them whole.

spcorange,"I’m 17 years old and halfway through my senior year in high school

Going into HS I had all accelerated classes, which was for the most part a good thing

Throughout elementary school I was always an honor student and in the Gate program, I even had the highest lexile (reading) score in my elementary school when I left, sadly my grades dipped a bit in middle school though, due to more of my grade being dependent on homework, which I had never really built the work ethic to do as previously I was always smart enough to just cruise by on tests

Technically speaking I still did ace the tests outside of math without studying but seen as they weren’t my entire grade anymore I still wound up having a mixed bag grade wise in middle school

In 8th grade, about a year after I’d say I started showing signs of depression my math teacher was arrested, this left us bouncing around substitutes that couldn’t teach well for an entire half of the year, leading me to become exceedingly worse in the only subject I didn’t cruise through, this made me fail my algebra class (despite my struggles I still was allowed to take algebra a year early, something that ironically enough fucked me over)

Freshman year of high school the tests got a bit harder, I was still saddled with all honors classes, and still had no work ethic for homework, I wound up failing my freshman English class (my previous best subject) due to this. Furthermore the school system royally fucked me in regards to math, as despite me failing algebra the school felt bad because of our circumstances and still put me into an accelerated geometry class before I had even fully grasped the basics of the preceding class.
I ended this year missing an English credit 

Sometime during my freshman year as well I started self harming, partially due to feeling like a failure because of my slipping grade and partially because of an emotionally abusive home life that I won’t go into extended detail here.

My sophomore year I dropped my gym class and told myself I’d take it online in favor of having an extra elective, which I chose French (a major mistake) This year I had no accelerated classes at all due to the previous year, which considering this was the first time in my entire academic history that this had happened I was crushed and hated myself. The workload itself for the basic classes however was easy for my and I breezed through all of my classes as I was back in an environment where my homework didn’t matter. The only exception to this rule was my algebra 2 class which, seen as how I didn’t pass algebra 1, I failed miserably, furthermore due to home life issues this year was by far the worst of my self harming and I was very very low
•I ended the year missing an English credit, a gym credit, and half a math credit

Junior year I started forcing myself to be more optimistic and hard working, I asked my previous English teacher (whose class I passed with an 107%) if I could try AP Lang for my class, to which he enthusiastically agreed, at the time as well I became the president of the creative writing club of my school and had also started taking AP Art which I greatly enjoyed. My math class was actually easy as my teacher placed me in Personal Finance, the one math class that actually teachers real life skills and yet the school somehow views as a class that honors students shouldn’t take (a fact which angers me to no end) the year seemed actually promising for the first time in forever, I had even quit Self harming, which despite having been in places about as mentally severe since I’ve managed to avoid going back to, however I still won’t wear shorts

The problem came when I realized that right off the bat due to no one else in my previous English class going into AP I hadn’t been informed of the summer assignment, leading me to having to make 90 flashcards and write an extremely long essay as homework on my first day, which at the time I was still trying to tough out. The workload that came with AP Lang however promptly overwhelmed me and I started failing the class
As for my AP art class I started to grow self deprecating as I didn’t and still rightfully dont find my skills to be at all at the level of those around me, (I believe I only got in because the teacher liked me and I was quiet)
•despite the struggles I had in this year I was still only missing an English credit, a gym credit, and half of a math credit

Now onto this year

I was recommended to take APEX classes for my missing credits, something which I was prepared to do however no one ever helped me or told me how to go about signing up

Due to my shyness/anxiousness and my parent’s ineptitude with using the Internet I wound up staying silent on the matter, meaning I went into this year essentially knowing whatever I did I would fail without those credits

Everything started to seem more pointless and with our learning being entirely online and no longer having the social pressure of being in building I quickly started to sleep through or just forget about classes, so much so that I went two weeks without attending my art class as it was my first of the day and I’d sleep through my alarm (something previously highly unlike me)

At this point even if I started trying now I’d likely still fail every class I have this year, as well as still miss my previous credits

This along with my depression in general only getting more severe and intrusive thoughts getting more common, as well as a slew of home problems due to a recent familial death and upcoming move that no one wants, I’ve hardly had the energy to exist

I’ve calmed myself and convinced myself to ignore it with personal promises of getting my GED

However I’m still terrified of when my mom finds out that I didn’t/won’t graduate, and I’m constantly feeling like a failure and a mistake and a fuck up whenever I think of academics

EmmaIsBoosted,"Just so everyone knows I have PTSD and ADHD. I’m already going to therapy and on medication. 

I would first like to state that the suicide hotline is amazing and the women I talked to was so nice and she was so supportive and did her best. She tried to give me resources and she really validated my feelings. She was great 

The issue is me. I’m at a point in my mental health journey where I know my feelings and reactions are wrong. I want to be a good person and not be toxic to others in my life so I make an effort to change my thinking or calming down if I’m upset or trying to rationalize. I have kaiser and the therapy sucks. I e been through 2 therapists already and the appointments are 3 weeks apart and I’m on Prozac and Wellbutrin. And my boyfriend really helps me with my life rn. I can’t eat or sleep or do work or shower really without assistance cause my ADHD executive dysfunction is soooo bad (basically it’s where I want to do a task but the energu required to START the task is like 100x harder. Even for things I like like video games, hobbies, but also work, school, taking care of myself. and I WANT to do all that stuff. So bad)
my boyfriend who has been through therapy already and knows a lot of coping has been helping me and we work on separation anxiety and rejection sensitivity and jealousy. He doesn’t just gibe me, he puts down boundaries and then teaches me how to over come them (ex. Jealousy of one of his friends, he told me that he’s not gonna stop a friendship just because I don’t like her but he also invited me to hang out with her a lot and talk with her and like talk to me about her so I can know her as a person and trust her and trust him) 
So basically my boyfriend is helping me through a lot. I’m 20 and just started this path of mental health growth. 

The issue is, he now works 6 days a week. 8 hours a day. From 11pm to 7am. I am a student and I work in a restaurant. We live together and have for awhile. Our time together has gone from like the whole evening and the morning and in between classes and stuff to like 2 hours a day. He’s been working there about 2-3 weeks now and he’s doing well and making friends and getting money. And I feel so lonely and helpless. 

And like it’s not his fault. We both need money. We can’t afford NOT to do this. I don’t wanna be upset at him and I don’t wanna be upset that he’s gone cause that won’t do any good 

I try to keep myself occupied and I try to do things but I can’t even sleep or eat. I reached out to a friend and she told me to just “be your own person it’s not that hard your boyfriend shouldn’t be responsible for your happiness”. I freaking know that! I know! I don’t want to feel this way. I WANT to eat. I WANT to sleep. I WANT to be content on my own. Not even happy, I just wanna be content. I want to do hobbies and have a life and not rely on 1 or 2 people and I’m working on it. With my boyfriend. With my therapist. With a psychiatrist. And progress is being made. But this job started 2 weeks ago and I just can’t handle it anymore. I miss my boyfriend. I want him home. I want to sleep and eat and live. 

Basically the lady on the suicide hotline said that I was at a point of self awareness and that I’m already doing all the things she’d suggest. She said that I had to advocate for myslef better for kaiser and I’m gonna try to do that I guess. But she said that there’s nothing an external person can do. I have to figure it out on my own. And that’s the things, I can’t rn. I can’t. I want to die. I want to disappear. I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I’ve been trying to work things out. Trying different methods. Reaching out to support groups. I can’t call my family because I come from an abusive past. Nothing is working. So I finally just broke and called the suicide hotline and they can’t help me either. And it’s nobody’s fault. I’m just so sad. I can’t do this anymore",I know. I’m trying. I’m doing all the things and I’m doing all the work and trying so hard not to let this get to me and be my own person but I can’t. I just wanted some freaking advice on how to calm down anxiety. Not to be told that my feelings are wrong. Like I know they are wrong. I don’t want to be a victim. I don’t want to be hurt anymore. I want to be normal so bad. But I can’t,I don’t want to be better than them I just wanted some advice and stuff ya know :\,"I made a post on r/relationships about how I’m really struggling with my boyfriend working nights (now we have opposite schedules) and now I’m spending a lot of time alone and I’m having HELLA executive dysfunction
Like not eating or not showering or not doing anything but laying there. Barely on phone
So I posted on there expressing these emotions of frustration cause I don’t wanna feel this way and I want to be able to handle being alone and all that. I’m in therapy. I have medication. But it takes time and this situation came out of nowhere and time and my boyfriend and I where working on separate issues slowly by having him take day trip or weekend trips to his friends in LA every month to get me used to being alone more. But then it went from that to I don’t get to sleep with him at night and he sleeps all day and I can’t be with him cause he has difficulty sleeping. His time when he is awake I’m usually at my job and he also is a person that needs space and time and breaks from work and people 
I’m just so frustrated cause I just wanted advice and so coping and some support but they attacked me saying “you can’t expect him to be the only person responsible for yourself happiness” “you aren’t special lots of people spend time alone” etc. 
it just just so much more now and I’m like fuck I’m trying. I agree with them. I WANT to be better. I want to be able to be on my own and be content but I can’t yet 
It feels like they are asking me out a fire when I don’t even know where to find water and they just keep shouting “use water omg you’re so stupid”",Before I knew him I lived alone in my car and worked 6 days a week because my family abused me and I had my life threatened my whole life. I’m sorry I went to the wrong subreddit. I should have gone to mental help but I thought relationships might have some advice instead of all this shaming and saying “just be okay with it” when I’m trying. I’ve been trying and it’s not working and I don’t have a therapy appointment til another week. I’m sorry. I’m on here cause I WANT to be able to handle this. I WANT to get to a better mental space. I’m going to therapy. Me and my partner have made conversations and boundaries and do have lives outside each other. He is a huge advocate in mental health and helped me sign up for therapy but also puts up boundaries so I don’t be a bad girlfriend to him that I respect and have to work on with my mental health. But I’m so sorry that I don’t wanna go back to living alone and I just wanted someone to be like “hey try this game” or “maybe visit him on his break once a week” or “ I understand it sucks but just gotta work on it”. Not everyone is has a perfect mental health or a perfect life. I’m sorry I won’t post on this relationship thread again,I am as well sorry for not being clear. It’s through kaiser tho and I have to keep requesting new ones that can work with me. And appointments are 2-3 weeks apart. I can’t afford out of system therapy,I know. I’m required to do 3 sessions with each therapist before I can request a new one (I have kaiser and I can’t afford out of pocket/out of kaiser therapy). And the appointments are 2-3 weeks apart. So it really freaking sucks. The only way I can get better treatment is if I get hospitalized or something and I work 6 days a week and barely make ends meet so I couldn’t afford not to work,"I know. My psychiatrist is nice tho. She listens to me, but we only meet every 6 weeks so see if we need to change my medication. That’s why I’m trying to reach out on reddit to like make some connections or understanding. But I think I posted this in the wrong subreddit due to the fact this is more about my mental health then my boyfriend","She hasn’t told me to do anything. She keeps saying, if there’s issues with separation anxiety then I should find ways to go with him. She is the 3rd therapist I’ve talked to thru Kaiser and the mental health is terrible. I’m researching it and learning stuff about it on my own but I can only do so much so fast","I also think it’s understandable that I’d be upset that I can only see i boyfriend 2-3 hours a day and then not being able to go into our room when he’s sleeping in our room during the day. And the hours he does spend awake and our time lines up he needs to destress and relax. Which I understand, and I know everyone needs time to themselves and I understand what my boyfriend has to do/need. But I need things too. I shouldn’t be alone 21 hours of my day due to Covid and no friends","I am in therapy. As well as seeing a psychiatrist. He’s not the one responsible for all my happiness and I knwo and we’ve have this conversation before and discussed it and we were working on it together as ways to deal with separation anxiety slowly but this job came out of nowhere. I have lived on my own and I have been myself and I wasn’t happy then either no matter what I did. It’s not as simple as “loving yourself” when I have childhood abuse, ptsd, adhd and anxiety. Like I’m going to therapy. I’m working so hard. I have journaling. What am I supposed to do?","I am in therapy as well as seeing a psychiatrist. I have ADHD, anxiety and PTSD so meeting new people and interacting has been incredibly difficult. I’m aware my happiness shouldn’t rely on him but I’m isolated from my my family due to abuse as a child. I can’t make friends easily. And I can’t “love myself” yet. I’m doing the shit and knowing what’s toxic and doing my best but that doesn’t change how I feel and how it affects me and I how I act. Like saying “you gotta be happy by yourself” is something that I’ve been working on for a long time. I’m looking for advice or just support or understanding","Boyfriend m26 
Me f21

Edit: !! I’m sorry I went to the wrong subreddit. I should have gone to mental help but I thought relationships might have some advice instead of all this shaming and saying “just be okay with it and stop relying just on him for happiness” yes what do you think I’m trying to ask here. I’ve been trying and it’s not working and I don’t have a therapy appointment til another week. I’m sorry. I’m on here cause I WANT to be able to handle this. I WANT to get to a better mental space. I’m going to therapy. Me and my partner have made conversations and boundaries and do have lives outside each other. He is a huge advocate in mental health and helped me sign up for therapy but also puts up boundaries so I don’t be a bad girlfriend to him that I respect and have to work on with my mental health.

Not everyone is has a perfect mental health or a perfect life. I’m sorry I won’t post on this relationship thread again !!

Boyfriend started working nights


My boyfriend started working nights and my mental health is suffering


My boyfriend started working a job that’s 6 days a week from 11pm-7am. He’s the one who usually helps me start tasks (like eating, bathing, working on hw) but now that he’s gone all night and sleeps all day I’m really struggling. I tried a few hobbies and they entertained me for the first few days but now nothing interests me. I stared at the ceiling crying for an hour because this is how it’s gonna be until AT LEAST January. 


I have anxiety and trauma from childhood and sleeping with him made sleeping so much easier. Now I’m not eating, not sleeping, not working
For context me and my bf are in kinda a bad place financially and this is the only job that has accepted him and he applied to over 100 places (I know cause I was helping him and did like half of them) 


It’s even worse cause I have college in the morning (when he comes home) and I work as a server til late into the night (10-11pm) and he wakes up usually around 8:30pm. So the time we spend together went from most of the day and thru the night to like two hours a day. I cry everyday and I’m not happy in the slightest but there’s nothing I can do and him seeing me sad is straining us even worse


Any help or tips? Because I can’t stress him out even more than he is and I can’t change this situation

Edit: I am in therapy and seeing a psychiatrist. I’m on Prozac and Wellbutrin 


TL:DR: my boyfriend and my schedules have been completely switched so our time together is non existent even tho we live together and I don’t know how to cope. Please give advice","I feel like I make an initial connection and feel really good but you know, people are people and once they seem angry at me or say stuff that reminds me of my triggers I just shut down. It’s so hard cause I have a lot of “friends” but like I feel isolated cause I just shut down. I wanna believe that love is possible for us but it’s going to take work/therapy/commitment to have a healthy relationship","My boyfriend started working a job that’s 6 days a week from 11pm-7am.

My friend, family and long term bf who I live with too. It’s so frustrating cause I feel so alone and like I can’t trust anyone but then when someone tries to reach I get scared or passive or do the “I have a headache I’m just gonna go home” thing. I don’t know how to get over this currently so sorry not helpful but yes, same experience",Thank you. I’m waiting for my boyfriend to get off from work and to talk with him. I’ve been trying to distract myself and I took a long shower and that made me feel better but as soon as I got out it came back. Even now I’ll deeply breath 5 minutes and I’ll feel calm but as soon as I stop it just comes back,"Same bro. I put off getting gas until I’m at like 1 mile. Or put off eating til I’m nauseous. I have no clue how my roommate managers to exercise, cook, clean and enjoy herself like everyday. I feel like I do one task a day and that’s it. I’m sorry you’re stuck","That makes sense. I recommend a shower then if you just want to calm down rn. Put on some music and just focus on getting all clean or something. That’s worked for me in the past and a lot of my friends with similar issues. Good luck, if you need someone to talk to or something I’d be down to talk. But like no pressure cause weird person on internet can make people anxious too. Good luck!","I had a really scary event happen at work yesterday that triggered my PTSD really bad in a way I haven’t experienced in over a year. My boss was screaming at me for something that another coworker did wrong, and was angrily slamming things and stuff, he apologized later but I still felt so scared like I was back at home with my step mom or my brother with their anger that didn’t make sense, or how my brother attacked me or my siblings for little reason (e.i. Someone woke him up/ he doesn’t money/ not allowed to skip school). And even today I’m just so scared. I worked again this morning and just was shaking and avoiding him and working extra hard to please him and as soon as I left the building I threw up from being so dizzy and scared. Still shaking now and the nausea comes in waves. Any advice how to calm down?",I get what you mean. The anxiety of “he could do something and I’d never know” and the sudden change to your daily schedule can be really difficult. When I get into these situations I try to really get into a video game or activity and like activity try to reach out to other friends (even voice call/chat) or post on reddit to feel connected to people. This is really silly sounding but when I’m alone and feelings really sad I go on tik tok because I’m seeing all these people doing different things (often by themselves) and I feel like more content in the world I guess. Idk I still suffer a lot with this issue but I hope some of these suggestions help,"Dude I had the same experience. Whenever I played with dolls it was just about punishment or like them yelling or attacking another doll. I couldn’t understand healthy family dynamics and never understood when other girls played tea parties and dress up. My Nstep-mom treated me so badly when I was young (doing similar things as you stated) and I have PTSD from my brother repeatedly (for years) attacking me and having the cops called on him weekly (by me or my siblings). I understand your emotions so much, I recommend therapy, that’s where I’m currently at. Cause it sucks, I still get scared when people are just angry around me, even if they aren’t angry with me. Having N parents really fucks with kids man",I can’t even do the things I like. I love league of legends and got plat last season but haven’t played one ranked game this season cause I just can’t. I don’t eat and I’ve lost 30 pounds sense February. I just stay stuff sitting on my phone for hours doing nothing and it sucks. I have so much stuff I want to do. But brain says no,"Hello, these last few months I’ve been going on a mental health discovery to try and get better due to worsening mental and physical health. I have been formally diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD but I stumbled open a page about PTSD, curious, I read it and found that so much of it applied to my life and how I feel. However I feel like I’m “faking it” or that I couldn’t have it or that I’m tricking myself into having it just so I can have more excuses. But like I genuinely wanna know if this sounds similar to anyone else’s experiences because I want to get better and understand my problems and know what therapies are best for recovery. 

From the age of 4 to 18 I lived in a house hold with my emotionally abusing narcissistic step mom who had 4 other children that where biologically hers (classic Cinderella story) as well as a step brother with severe brain defeats that would cause him to go off/ attack/break or injure people and the stuff around you. (Broke window, throwing weights down the stairs, jumping on wind shields. Running around with knives. Etc.) 

obviously I became very hyper cautious, I could hear when the garage door was opening or when there were foot steps on the stairs or cars pulling up to the house. I would listen to see if they are talking about me and if they would come tell me what I did wrong or attack me. 

When I turned 18 I moved two hours away from school and never looked back. I went far away from them so there would be no casual visits, no nagging or no forcing me to interact with her. I got my own job and work 6 days a week and pay for everything I have (phone/insurance/car/loans/medical/etc) just to prove I don’t neeed them and I’m free and on my own. However I’m struggling in other aspects of life now. I strived in school as a way to escape home as soon as I could in college. The reason I did so many clubs was to avoid going home. Now there’s nothing motivating me and I’m failing at my school and I can finished projects or enjoy much of anything

When I lived in the college dorms, bangs or sounds on the stairs caused panic. When I rented a room from a family every step by my window or every shuffle In the hall way made me so paranoid and scared (they also Spoke Chinese and I had this paranoia they were always talking about me) And now that I’m living with my boyfriend (first time living with someone else) and two other friends. I constantly feel the need to check where people are and if I’m safe or if they are upset, or listen to the door or their footsteps, only now I don’t have a room to isolate in by myself where I know it’s mine and I’m safe. 

Any input and advice would be wonderful. Thank you for reading","I first want to say I’m sorry I don’t know all the slang or abbreviation that are in a lot of these posts I’m still fairly new in the community and trying to figure them out. But I am f20 and narcissistic step mom

Hey! I'm a new writer and this is the first project I have committed myself to trying to finish. I still have a bit to go but I have a good amount done as I am not good at finishing things I write. The plot is not clear as this is just the beginning chapter but in the future I may post other chapters as I critique and write more so I can get comments on the overall story. I guess I would want questions if things seem confusing, if there is some barebone sentences that need work, is the relationship I'm trying to show between Samuel and his Mom clear and any other critiques. Thanks!

(the horror aspect mostly comes in later chapters so apologies if the flair seems wrong for what your reading)","Mind you, this is my first critique here but I hope to improve (I will gladly take advice from experienced critics here) and that this will be helpful to you! I'll answer your questions and maybe add a few extra thoughts in with my responses to them. 

 *If this was a chapter one, would it hook you?* 

Yes, but it could use some work. The descriptions, worldbuilding, and writing style is all great but for me the protagonist just isn't that interesting. 

&#x200B;

You start the chapter with Wolfgang and his sister heading to this cemetery. I love the descriptions, especially this sentence or two: 

"" Somber shadows cloaked the vault of souls; candles, with nubs for wicks and little wax left sat idle in every corpse-chamber. Squarely in the room's center sat an altar. Its chipped top had many scars, scorched by fire and stained by blood.  ""

There are many descriptions showing the age of the cemetery and the ""scorched by fire and stained by blood"" piqued by interest. Is it some kind of religious ceremony? I like a lot of the worldbuilding that's subtly added. As a big fan of worlds that seem large in scale this interested me. Another worldbuilding addition that was clear is the Germanic language and the older sentence structure / speech. Some of the dialogue though was confusing to read/ For example, ""  Like as not, he’s come to ask what I’m making him for dinner"" maybe I am just not used to it but It does take me out of the experience when I have to re read dialogue during a scene because I'm confused. 

Characters aren't bad but I am more interested in the sister than our protagonist. He just comes off as uninteresting to me. Of course this is just the first chapter or so but his sister seems to be more layered with emotions. Using humor to relieve the tension and feeling frustrated with her brother being taken away. Wolfgang doesn't really seem to show many strong emotions but maybe that's how you wanted him to be? 

  *Is the religion (limitedly shown here) interesting? Cliché? Snoozefest?* 

The religion hints at interesting parts but I wouldn't say it actually interests me. 

&#x200B;

I mentioned previously of the ""scorched by fire and blood"" line that I found really interesting but besides that I didn't see anything that interesting about the religious part of the cemetery. I see hints of things like references to ""the Wanderer"" and ""the Shepard"" but it doesn't draw me in as I've seen it used many times in fantasy. I don't think this is a huge issue though as it is only the first chapter so it makes sense you wouldn't show it all now but it just doesn't interest me enough this early on. 

&#x200B;

 *Do the characters' personalities shine enough?* 

I find Matilda interesting, she's got this interesting thing going on where she uses humor to try and ease the situation. Especially the part where Wolfgang remarks about her ""quiet sadness."" I like the dynamic between her and Wolfgang but Wolfgang on his own isn't that interesting to me. There aren't a lot of things he seems passionate about or any layers to him. I find him the least characterized out of the characters presented. He seems like a leader but I don't see many traits about him. Julian is fine, not much too say about him except he seems like a joking friend but I liked him as a side character. 

&#x200B;

 *Does the setting interest you?* 

Yes. I think the setting definitely is one of the strong points. The language should be used carefully, as like I said some places are hard to read, but overall adds character to the dialogue. I honestly expected another medieval drama here but the revolver and airships excited me to what kind of technology is used in the story. You give excellent descriptions and I could hear the crunching of snow and the cemetery as they walked through it. We get some insight into the military which I imagine will be explored deeper but it's interesting enough with the ""Holy league"" being mentioned and I wonder what the deal was with the ""green or white uniforms"" Wolfgang comments on. 

&#x200B;

Overall I don't think this is a trainwreck at all. The chapter opens up a lot of interesting things to explore, especially the religious parts I want to find out more about, but the protagonist still seems kinda flat. There doesn't seem to be a lot of characterization for him or emotion towards the events in the story. Points where this could be explored is maybe his thoughts on his father, religion, military, or the pope dying. Just something to make me feel like he has a opinion or feeling. 

I hope this critique met the standards of the sub. I will try to be better with each one I leave and try to get some critiques done before I post any of my own work.","That video sounds hilarious, still have link?",I've been reloading on the website and app and still being buggy.

mybloodyvalentine_,"I’ve looked into telehealth therapy but can’t really find the energy to schedule anything. I’m taking medication that seems to somewhat help, but I am bad about taking it at the same time every night (sometimes I forget).

I am developing an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and have in the past done harder drugs (never to the point of addiction).

I just feel at a loss with life. All the classic stuff. I feel worthless, like a loser, like I will never accomplish anything. 

I spend most days sleeping, which I feel guilty about. It’s a cycle. 

I have a boyfriend who I love and our relationship is healthy but I feel guilty because I know I’ll never be happy. At least I feel that way.

Posting because I’ve been contemplating suicide lately.","So today I found out that a man I went to HR over who was sexist toward me (at this time he was subordinate to me and I was leading a project initiative he was a part of) got a promotion to work the same job as me. 

I’m livid. I’ve been with this company for around 5 years, and get along well with everyone. At this time (around 6 months ago) I was leading a project and he didn’t take my direction, demeaned my work, and spent his time going over my work to try finding something I had done wrong (when I had done nothing wrong). 

I was set to train whoever filled this position (him now I learned this morning) but reached out to my manager and told her I would no longer be participating in training because of this. 

Do I quit? I feel disrespected, gaslit, and angry. Please help.","I recently applied for a better position at my job that pays more, but would require a lot more work and added stress. I wasn’t necessarily set on getting the position and by no means expected to get it, but I prepared as much as I could for the interview keeping in mind I might turn it down if it was offered to me. 

I found out the other day that it wasn’t offered to me, which is fair, but I feel bothered and irritated by the reasons that were given. 

I have been with the company for nearly 4 years and am a very productive worker. Before COVID, I routinely was one of the most if not the most productive member of my team, sometimes over performing my teammates by very large margins. 

Despite this, I was rarely invited to participate in projects or given larger responsibilities. Other teammates who were way less productive than me were given them instead, even if I had been in the position longer than them. 

The bottom line is, I am younger than most of my teammates, and a woman. How could I be consistently overlooked for opportunities for both projects and career advancement when I am one of the most productive members? 

Am I lacking self awareness? Lately I have just been doing the bare minimum/what everyone else does because it seems to be what pays off at my “progressive” company. 

TLDR: worry I am being discriminated against but unsure if my feelings are founded.","Worked at exact for almost 5 years now. Fantastic company, great caring culture. This would never happen there.","Posting this here because I am chronically tired. I don’t believe I have narcolepsy because I never just fall asleep unannounced, but I rarely have motivation to do things. 

I’m 22 years old, exercise somewhat frequently, and eat pretty healthy. I have severe depression but take medication for it. I’m a smoker and maybe lactose and tolerant but drink  a lot of milk/eat a lot of dairy. 

What can I do? I’ve tried quitting smoking but haven’t gotten really far and I’m tired of being exhausted constantly. I’m also addicted to caffeine so maybe that’s a factor.",I’ve tried quitting smoking before and the longest I’ve gone is 2 months. Any advice when literally everyone around you smokes? I’ve been laying off drinking and I can’t really socialize anyway because of quarantine but my roommate smokes and my entire family does too. Help. I want this time to be the last,“Most people make friendships so high maintenance and stressful” facts . Never heard something more true in my life,That is really helpful,"Hey guys, I’m a 21 year old girl and I really just don’t enjoy most people’s company. There are very few people I enjoy hanging out with, and even then, the majority of the time it feels like an obligation rather than something I’d like to be doing. 

I have mild anxiety and severe depression and also bipolar disorder, which can sometimes make me feel and behave awkwardly, but I’m not an inherently awkward person and would say I actually have decent social skills when I try. It just exhausts so much energy and at the end of the day it more feels like keeping up appearances than spending time with people I actually want to spend time with. 

I feel extreme guilt and am further guilted by some old friends and I think newer friends are put off by me or ultimately decide I suck because I never engage with them wanting to make plans or form a friendship. I flake out a lot or just don’t respond if I feel overwhelmed. 

I have my job and I play music and I really love playing music but shows to me also just feel like something I only enjoy the playing part of. I listen to local bands I play with all the time and really love their music, but going to their show sounds terrible and stressful to me and so I usually just don’t go. 

At work I avoid talking to coworkers, and if I’m in public walking I usually just look away or at the ground if I see someone trying to engage with me. 

Why am I like this? I feel like I come off as an asshole to everyone who sees me behaving this way and I know it’s impolite and I should just enjoy other people but I really dislike socializing. 

Any advice or if anyone feels this same way I would like to hear how you handle it.",*advice,"How do you get yourself to be engaged in your hobbies? I work full time at a job that makes me unhappy, and I also am in school. I enjoy playing music, reading, and other forms of visual art (film, paintings, tv) but I don’t feel as interested in it as I did a few years ago. 

I find it difficult to define why I do things. Why I want a degree, why I want to make music. 

I know this is depression and I’ve been formally diagnosed but I don’t know how to deal with it. On top of everything I have been in an on and off toxic relationship with one of my band mates, they also struggle with depression. We don’t have conversations and I feel he holds me back from getting better. 

Advise? I want to feel engaged how I once did, so I can make music, and feel fulfilled generally."
barefootshinji,"i'm going to see a doctor later today, just wanna know what to expect.","No, talking does not help in my case. Because my country is full of dumb ass idiots who think that depression can be cured with religion and not medical treatment. ","I worked at a shoe store and I had to bear with smelly and nasty feet all day everyday and a lot of times I was disgusted by the amount of people who dont take good care of their feet hygiene. So those of you who love feet, why?",I saw a lot of comments how it is 'sexualizing gays' but the thing is I'm attracted to guys and I'm not into women and so I would much rather look at 2 guys than a man and woman pairing lol.
atlalune,"I have never had anyone close to me die suddenly (or otherwise) before. In that, I'm extremely lucky, and I recognize this. I certainly have it easier than a lot of people who're currently dealing with the loss of a loved one; I know this too. But every day, I feel like I'm grieving as if I *did* lose someone—or something—I cherish.

All the posts I see and read on Reddit about grief—I can relate to them more often than not, because my life for the past 8 months has been a non-ending stream of utter pain and denial and anger and regret. About grief coming in waves—I can relate to that too. It's ironic because as I've said, I've never lost anyone before. Most of the time I feel ridiculous for even feeling like this or relating to all the posts I see because what I've experienced is nothing compared to what they have.

Whenever I'm depressed and feel grief as if I've lost someone I hate it. It feels like an affront to those who're dealing with loss. But the ache is always there. The only thing I've truly lost is the chance of getting into/transferring to my dream university abroad after having toiled for five straight years in the third-world country where I live. I know it's superficial, which is why I hate hate hate why I'm feeling like this, but slowly witnessing everything you've worked so hard for for five years just topple down in front of you because of a series of misfortunes and wrong decisions even if you tried so desperately hard for it not to happen hurts like a b\*tch. It was like watching someone die in front of me within the span of a month despite all the interventions, etc. 

That's the only thing I've lost. But I hate that what I've been feeling for the past 8 months is so eerily close to what grieving people feel. It's like I'm disrespecting them for feeling this way, and I'm sorry. I sometimes wish I had a more valid reason to feel like this, because most of the time I feel pathetic.","Congrats! And the fact that you learned English from reading fics is absolutely *amazing*, to be honest :O I hope you continue writing and posting a lot more fanfics :)","It truly is, honestly! I've been feeling a tad bit insecure about my writing and the direction I was taking the fic in, but now I feel like I've finally gotten the reassurance I needed :( and not to mention the only artist that draws the rarepair that I ship replied to the tweet as well, so I found out that she's been following the fic too!",Thank you!!,"That's amazing :') It's one thing to read your fic, another to see a visual representation of it based on what your readers thought of it!",Thanks!,Hahahaha that hashtag is pretty funny! But it is kinda surreal knowing that somebody out there liked your work so much to talk about it on another site :'),"I write for a rarepair in an already niche fandom (think only \~6 fics out of  1k+ in the fandom's AO3 tag, 2 of which are mine). Today I was searching the characters' names on Twitter, which has been a daily routine of mine because as you know part of shipping a rarepair is looking for scraps basically everywhere. I usually put in various combinations of their names because they don't have an official ship name, and earlier I was on my third combination when the first tweet that popped up was from someone recommending my fic and calling it good!!!! I'm so happy lol I've gotten a few comments on the fic itself but I didn't think someone would like it so much as to advertise it on Twitter :(((","> Just don't consume it. Move on. 

This. *This*. I don't understand why it's so hard for people to comprehend that not consuming content on a ship they don't like is always an option, and that it's way more preferable than going out of their way to send hate on something somebody worked genuinely hard on. If it's not hurting anyone, then why?

I'm currently new in a fandom where there are pretty toxic shipping wars, to the point that a writer has been harassed both in AO3 *and* Twitter; someone even made a profile just to publicly point out to why she's wrong to ship them, etc. She rarely ever even tweets about them anymore because she gets hate almost every time she does????? And there literally isn't anything wrong with the pairing—just that the guy is almost always paired up with the MC of the series. I don't get why people are so threatened at the thought of people shipping the character with another person when 90% of the fanfics in the fandom are about the MC and that character already.

Thankfully the fic I'm in the process of writing/posting about a certain rarepair involving the MC hasn't yet received any hate directly, though I have seen quite a few people on Twitter calling the pairing their NOTP and wondering why people ship it when Character B is *this* and *that* and *this*. I don't really wish to partake in discourse because everyone has their own opinions so I usually just ignore them even if it does bug me a little bit, because some of the takes are just... *eh*. I'm planning to extract myself from the fandom after I finish it because the toxicity is honestly disgusting imo and I can't deal.",The one good thing that’s come out of this quarantine is definitely all this time to pursue our hobbies haha,It's >!Caroline's sunroom!< that was only very recently added in the 1.4 update :) not a mod lol,It's >!Caroline's sun room!< from the 1.4 update :),"And this is something I realized only very recently. I honestly haven't been mentally okay during the  quarantine because of all the stress with COVID as well as political/social issues that have been sprouting up in my country. Long story short, I've been suffering from anxiety way more than usual and also with memory loss, which is, as you know, kind of commonplace when you're mentally ill.

So here's the thing: I've been working on a fic since May and, after around two drafts and three outlines have managed to churn out over 52,000 words in the current (and final) draft that I'm writing and I'm only 3/4 through! I feel like I'm going to end up with at most 65,000 words, which I know isn't much by fanfic standards but man am I proud. This is the longest fic I've ever written in the 7 years I've been writing fic. The last time I published something was in 2016 (or 2017?) and I swear I have a truckload of abandoned WIPs in my drive that I feel bad for not finishing.

The determination and fulfilment I've gotten over writing and finishing this fic has helped me stay grounded amidst everything. I've actually been able to fix my sleep schedule and draw up a proper daily schedule (that revolves around writing with a few breaks to play games in between) that I follow meticulously because of it, giving me the semblance of 'normalcy' that I desperately need in these trying times lol. Writing about my favorite pairing (as of the moment) falling in love during an angst-filled journey has also helped with the anxiety somewhat, and having to actually USE my brain to come up with decent sentences and paragraphs has helped mitigate the memory loss somewhat too.

Skimming through this subreddit also puts me in a good mood, especially seeing all the posts under the 'Celebrate!' flair :)",I use [Seasonal Villager Outfits](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2449) by paradigmnomad! Villagers changing their clothes depending on the season/weather gave the game much more life to me :),That's amazing!

Yeah never mind the fact that I spent 7 months studying for the entrance exam, and 4 years keeping my grades up to be a competitive enough applicant. But sure, ~god is good~ like I didn’t put in work at all LMAO

Also, congrats on getting into college!",What :O I didn’t know that! Thanks 😭,Haha thanks! I was debating on posting this because my farm quite literally looks awful because I was too focused on completing the Community Center instead of making it pretty :'),"I'm not so sure, but I have a feeling they'll wilt if you let them stay there until after the season they're supposed to be grown in :/","I was honestly pissed at Martha when I was watching The Americans because of how utterly oblivious she was, but >!by the time she'd found out the truth about Phillip and had to be sent to Russia for her safety, I felt kind of bad for her and even liked her then.

Tbh I cannot comprehend how you must be feeling right now but I wanted to share my experience with my eye problem. It is not as severe as your situation but still giving me nightmares.

I am developing some serious problem in my left eye.

I had LASIK surgery 3 years ago, at that time my eyesight had become very poor. Like -10 and -12. After operation I felt like I was in a completely different world. Everything was so clear.

Later I started developing some blurred spots in my left eye. To be precise, if I am reading a sentence then its above the word slightly towards left. Not on the word I am focussing but the area of blurred spot touched that word. Anyways, I was busy with work, read about it internet, didn't find anything helpful. And its only with left eye, my right eye vision is perfectly clear.

Fast forward to current year, since January eyesight in left is worsening everyday and its very fast. Due to corona everything was locked down. Now I have exams in November and I don't even have time to pee.

Current situation is, when I close my one eye and look from affected eye, eyesight is worse than it was before operation, at -12 !! I planning to get a thorough checkup after my exams. Idk man, I am really scared about it.

Good luck for your operation man. I hope things work out well for you.

2. Save the URL - if URL deleted later then.. you lose the article.

I don't understand why he cares.,"That's not why I do it. It's a struggle. Everyone knows about it- his mom included. I don't hide it. I deal with it as best I can. I used to not be like this but medication and chemotherapy over 10 years has affected me negatively, and I was raised where this was acceptable so I just black out. He doesn't deserve it and I just want him to be happy like he deserves. But when we talk about it he says he knows I'm not this, and he remembers who I was before the medicine. I just came here because I wanted to know if I should do what I think is right, as painful as it would be, even if he doesn't want me to.","I do, we've made a lot of progress but I slipped up yesterday. I've tried to leave before, to protect him, I guess. He said it's not my decision to make and my therapist agrees but I feel like if I keep messing up every couple of months he'll either cheat or leave or both. And I couldn't be mad if he did because I have these moments when I feel like this and I haven't been able to 100% get control and I hurt him. I just hate this so much.  ",We've been working through a lot I just really struggle when there are setbacks ,"It's much better since I've been going to therapy but last night I was exhausted and stressed over money (I was hospitalized for 2 weeks and lost my income, our main source of income, during that time) and I just feel like a burden because of my chronic illness and on top of that I have these moments of pure rage where I lash out and hurt him. I've talked about leaving before to get him away from my toxicity but he refuses and tells me that it isn't my choice. I just am at a loss. ",Oh we don't have money. I take care of him financially but I still feel like I should go.,I do love him. But I'm starting to realize that no matter how hard I try I'll always be toxic.,I've been in therapy 6 months and it's better but it still happens occasionally and I feel like shit.,"I am. I just get stressed out and depressed, then we fight and I can't get away from the argument and I lash out. My therapist and I are making tons of progress but when I get like that I basically black out, hit then realize what I did and cry and feel like the piece of shit I am.","As much as I hate to admit it, and as much as I like to think I'm a good person- I'm a terrible wife. I am working on a lot and I am in therapy to get a better handle on myself. I come from an abusive household so my go to- when crap hits the fan- is physical violence. I hate that I'm like that and it doesn't happen often, but once is too much. Should I leave, I guess is what I want to know? He won't go but I wouldn't stay with a man that hurt me, so should I leave for him- to make his life better?

Idk but I remember when I was about 14 my brother who's a couple years younger than me and my uncle who is the same age as me got invited on holiday with my Nanna and aunt, I got left out and it really hurt. It always hurts when I get left out now and I'm 24 years of age. I feel like I don't exist at my dad's, as none of my siblings talk to me and my Nanna (dad's mam) is so harsh to me. My dad once said that my little boy is good looking and talented like me and him lol then my Nanna turned around and said ""which one is he like"". She's never really bothered with me so that just makes me wonder more. Am I being silly? I feel super hurt.

2a2i,"I (22M) always thought I had ADD and was naturally demotivated. But tonight as I was talking to my mom I was wondering if I was depressed. I have always found that I don't feel anything. That I was always in neutral mode. That life was making the choices for me. And that no matter what the choice was, I was neither happy nor disappointed. I never felt any emotion coming to me and pushing me to accomplish anything. But I've been like this for ages and I always told myself that this was the norm.

Tonight, before going to bed, I was talking to my mother about an injury that happened to me almost a year ago. We were talking about how this injury has affected my life since the day it happened and how I still haven't been able to heal it. And during the discussion I felt this anger taking hold of me. I don't know what I was angry about or what caused this emotion. But I hadn't felt this for a very long time. Maybe years. It gave me a lot of motivation to care about my injury and get my life back on track. It even seems like it put my ADD on hold and my lack of motivation is gone. 

Then, I started thinking about this sudden anger and wondering about the famous quote from master yi: ""Anger gives motivation without purpose"" which led me to stumble upon an other quote: ""Depression is anger turned inward"" and I wonder if what I had all these years (my ADD and lack of motivation to get shit done with my life) is actually a depression that I have had for all these years.",!remindme 11 days,"thank you very much. but I am still reluctant to take any supplement for fear that my body understands that it no longer needs to produce it, that it stops producing the right healthy dose. and that I must increase my dose to overcome not only the deficit in my body which no longer produces it, but also my initial problem. which would give a very large dose and idk... would probably create some kind of addiction? ... I don't know really. But I think the same way about drugs to treat ADHD and that made me stop taking them several years ago. I am still young (22 years old), but I am wondering if I should give up in this fight (find a cure for my ADHD) and accept my fate (take the drugs) because it can be really hard sometimes to live with it, it's like I do not own my life, it's like the ADHD runs it for me and the only thing I would really wish for is to own my life, have control over it and not have the side effects of the long term use of adhd drugs."," I know the severity of my ADHD symptoms are seriously dependent on how much time I sleep and every night I have the same problem before going to bed. When it's 8-9am I tell myself that I should get ready to sleep and go to bed soon. Only, I always find myself with this fucked up feeling of not wanting to go to bed because I have the impression of not having benefited enough from my evening / of not having been stimulated enough and that prevents me from going to bed. I have the impression that it would spoil my evening. and yet I know very well that it would be better to go to bed early, since my next day would be much better with a decrease in the severity of my ADHD symptoms. help me please!",Fuck!

I'm a 23 year old female who for a long time, but it's been worse recently, has been very unhappy with her life. I feel like I don't have any meaning or purpose, I have nothing in my life that makes it worthwhile aside from my pets, but that's it. 

2 years ago I had a cancer scare that resulted in me needing major surgery and now having a lifelong chronic illness. That seems to be the start of everything going downhill for me. Shortly after my cancer scare the relationship I was in ended, and for 2 years I've been single with absolutely zero love life. No dating, no prospects, nothing. My chronic illness has absolutely destroyed my body and my self-esteem so I'm convinced no one will ever love me or want me like this. To make it worse, all my friends are either married or in long-term relationships so I'm always the lonely one. They also are so much more established in life than I am and I feel like an utter failure all the time. They all have houses of their own with their partners, and I'm a college student still living at home because I'm broke (I work part time when I don't have class). 

I have nothing going for me in life so I've decided to just try and go to graduate school, because what else am I going to do... problem is that between having a chronic illness that causes extreme fatigue and the exhaustion of going to school full time and working part time, I've had no time to study for my GRE and worry that I won't get into grad school... then what am I going to do... 

To sum it all up, I feel like I'm surrounded by all these people who are happy and in love and are moving up in life, and I have nothing and no one... and it's suffocating. Most days I wonder why I'm even still here. I don't talk about any of this with anyone because my friends honestly don't care and I'm not close with any family. I never let it show that I'm sad but I'm really not doing well. 

Sorry for the long post, if anyone sees this thanks for listening","You sound just like me! 23F, applying to grad school, dating life sucks, etc. Feel free to message me if you ever need or want to talk.",Thank you kindly!,"It's my favorite quote in the whole anime.

I love him and he deserved so much better",Reiner is also best boy,He is baby,Thank you very much!,Thank you! He is super underrated but he's my favorite character ever,"I thought it was implied that the Beast Titan had the power to turn them into Titans. Not sure how it works exactly, but we know that he can control titans to an extent. Also during the battle in season 3 part 2, BT calls them ""his titans"" and we see them pop up out of nowhere in the semi circle formation when the BT appears. Although, why he doesn't just turn the soldiers into titans too is a good point.","Thank you! I will gladly follow back, I love reptiles too!","I have no actual idea, but I always just chalked it up to Annie crystallizing and because Eren was touching her he started to crystallize, too","I mean I'm completely biased because Bert is my all time favorite character and I high key love him, but putting that aside, I always thought he was such an underrated character. I know everyone sees him as weak, timid, and a follower, but Bert had to keep the warrior's mission together every time Reiner went off the deep end. He had to constantly keep him in check and bring him back to reality even though it was obviously really hard on Reiner and on himself. Bert is a person who cares a lot and is sensitive so imagine how hard it was on him to do this mission in the first place and to kill all his friends, let alone hold it all together while big strong Reiner repeatedly lost it. There's a reason Bert was given the strongest most powerful titan as Reiner says. Bert will always be an amazing and totally undervalued character and his ending killed me because he of all people deserved so much better.

:D","There's this guy who meant the world to me. It wasn't a random relationship. What I had with him was deep, emotional, mutual, perfect. He meant the world to me. He made me feel special. And it was the best time of my life. Our relationship was a short one, but it deeply impacted me. He quite literally changed my life. I don't know how or why, but I'm a completely different person now than before I got to know him. I have a new appreciation for the world, I'm practically fearless, and I'm a better version of who I used to be.

&#x200B;

But this guy and I are done. And he brought these changes into my life. I like who I am now, but I can't help but feel like I'm still like this for *him.* Everything reminds me of him. I want to get over him. I want to forget him. But to do that, I'll have to go back to my old self, and I'm not sure I want that. I know we're done. I know I want to continue living like this. But every time I do anything that reminds me of him (and I have to do a lot of those things), I feel like I'm only doing it for validation from him. He was a really smart guy. He liked science, he liked math, he liked learning. I now also love learning. I'm enjoying my subjects, but some part of my brain tells me I'm only putting effort into studying to impress him. Even though I'll never see him again.

&#x200B;

I remind myself of him. He's impacted my life too much, and I'm not complaining one bit. I like myself now. But to get over him, I'll have to go back to the old version of me - always unmotivated and generally unimpressive. This isn't a break-up.

I live in rural Australia (not many services) and I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown, everything is getting to me and I am crying every day non stop and the topic of opting out permanently hasn’t faded for the last few days like it usually does.

I personally feel like I am in danger and I don’t know what to do to prevent this before it actually happens, who can I see?

Also lifeline is a terrible service and I am not interested in any of those types of things so please save your energy 

Thank you","No I meant he would think he would owe me for the missed shot hence why he wouldnt tell me he missed , but I wouldnt view it that way as I originally stated if you maybe mis-read .","I live in Australia, so prices are fk'd as it is , and due to covid it's gone up even more, 100 is a steal. It is 'pure' though , at least 60-70%. I have had people bang dope that I hand picked and bought myself online that had feedback from people who tested purity at 77 and 74 % in 2 batches and it was very similar if not the same. pure white from south east asia, dissolves clear. most definately alot stronger than the market grade rubbish that really disappointed me in the past.",And he also like tested to see if I was cool with the idea of someone (him) driving around after eating 25 Valium and when I said no that’s so fuking dumb he quickly changed it to nah I only take like 10 and it’s nothing to me cos of my tolerance,"But I also find some dudes lie about other things unrelated like for example this dude lost his job as a mobile car emergency repair guy cos he drove the work vehicle off the road into a tree and then a creek,  and his version of events has changed the 3 times it’s been brought up and it’s all sort of to defend his innocence","Haha can you answer me this since you have been very helpful to me with this (thank you) 

Never trust an addict right ? Like no matter what , at some point , they will take advantage if they are desperate enough right ?

And they lie a lot if it serves their purpose yeah ?","Oh ok , so this fella has been doing it 17 years, obviously he would know what would of happened and he has lied to me and said it’s a rare allergy thing , because I wouldn’t know what the fuk it would be since I’m iv naive. And because he would feel like he would owe me a new shot (which would be $100) however I wouldn’t expect that from him from an accidental mistake I would prefer honesty so I know whether I need to go to er or not.

It’s disappointing because i liked this guy and thought he was more genuine than junkie but my experience with most people in this game , infact probably nearly every addict , is that there’s layers underneath the mask they put on.","Oh shit I’ll take your word for it then

How the fuck did he do that because I swear he used the same vein","I’m super super super naive so please excuse me if I’m talking out of place , I don’t think he hit an artery as the blood looked the same and I had no issues with blood pissing out everywhere 

Either way ; is it something I need to go get checked , because I still have swelling after 6 hours","I had 0 bleeding

Honestly it felt like he was injecting hot water like burning hot water that was the very first sign  of things going wrong , as he first pushed in the plunger

Do I need to go see ER tomorrow ?","Most likely a nerve right ? Because it burnt down my arms and down to my finger tips , and the guy went for the same spot we had success prior , maybe he missed by a bit and hit a nerve..

So Um am I fucked and what do I do ?","Not really no, I have 4 discs with DDD in L1 to L4 that have been fucked since I was 19 and I am currently 28. It only gets worse over time and its a disease in old people and very rare for people my age.

 I could never get legit painkillers because of my age, but I never wanted to give up the sports I played which was a terrible decision, so I had to buy them and I got hooked and now H is cheaper than pills for me.","( I cannot see a doctor yet it is currently 11PM in rural australia)

 I have to get someone to fix me up cos I can’t do it myself. This guy has done it for me 5 times without issue.

Today we picked up some pure , we had a little taste in the car and it was fantastic, so after we safely got home we went for round 2

I have fresh healthy veins as I’m fairly athletic despite my addiction and don’t really need to tie a belt around cos they are so prominent; my dude did it in the same vein he did yesterday for me , and first it felt like hot burning water being injected into my veins, next i literally thought my fingers were hovering over a lighter or something because they burned really hot; then my skIn went bright red all over and not just near the injection site. Then some of my fingers and part of my hand went numb and I couldn’t close my fist . I started to panic but my dude said it’s a rare thing that happens some times it’s an allergic reaction to the needle ... but I was pissed because I didn’t get high and that was a $100 point of pure loaded and gone , but my dude assured me everything was normal and he didn’t miss (I assume he didn’t because the blood entered the cannon nicely as normal and only had an issue when the liquid started to be re injected)

It started to ease up after 10 mins and I felt kinda happy so I figured the shot worked but I just didn’t get a rush .. however after 30 mins , my forearm muscle just above the injwction site started to swell a bit like a ball , it’s however gone down but my muscle feels tender like I’ve pulled or like how you feel when you lift weights after a long break from lifting .

What happened to me ??","Also I have questions like if it's pure and dissolves in water as a clear color , do you need to cook it in the spoon still ?","Hey from down under ; I have a question as an addict viewing your culture around opiates through mediums like reddit here but also in the music , as just as we do in classic Aussie class, we just copy what you do and  I’m seeing the glorification of opiates creeping into mainstream over here. But it’s really cringe when we do it.

Why do you guys who do Percs also use lean? Wouldn’t it be more economical to just stick to Percs because they are way stronger ? I get that also lean as promethazine in it, however don’t you guys have it in over the counter allergy medication that you can buy? We can over here buy it as ‘allersoothe’ and we are super tight on drugs compared to you guys so I’d figure you’d have it? 

Could be wrong though, as when I first started using opiates, I could buy codeine tablets from any different chemist without ID and could get 30x 12.8/200 or 40 x 15/500 for $6 a box from any chemist in site (cold water extraction to get pure codeine) 

However I believe oxycodone is way more available over in the states than it is here in Australia ? I am very lucky I’ve got a friend who’s like a 1 in 50,000 chance of having a script that gets her 90 x 20mg of oxycodone in powder format (inside gel cap) so essentially 1.8grams of oxycodone powder and whatever the inactive filler is.

Wouldn’t you guys ‘graduate’ from lean fairly quickly if you are also using percs more and more? Or is it defiantly more of a cultural thing ?","I appreciate and understand the suspicions but I’m not really here to defend my cause for need , I get enough of that from the people I’m around that know I have them, I just want to know if I’m out of pocket $68.

The whole things maybe messed now but hopefully there are still things you can learn from it ",Thanks a ton! Makes sense now!,"Great thank you!
Does the same apply for Pankratrops?",Title ,Is it supposed to be a metaphor about learning to love yourself ?,"Called By is definitely a good card, I chose to cut it as of now given how light on handtraps the current format is but I could definitely consider adding them back.

Hat tricker is a great card but it's kinda reliant on your other combos working first so I'm kinda okay with it being only searchable through brilliant. That said it is a free special summon that works after you've Regulator'd so maybe it's worth just for that.

Lonefire is a great addition but I'm skeptical cutting Allure for it given how most of the deck is dark and Allure itself is kind of like a Called By because it always baits Ash.

I agree Regulator is iffy at times but it is a +2 and for the times your best play is Bagooska pass he's pretty good. Plus if you cut it you have to consider if the other Time Thief cards are good enough on their own without their Rescue Rabbit and the answer is ehhh probably not. ","Thanks a ton for your comment!

Super poly is a fantastic idea and I'll definitely be siding a copy. 

Predaplants eat your normal summon, yes, but going into brilliant gives you minimum four bodies with seraphinite and the performage engine which you can then use your extra normal or search the PK trap for full bardiche + azathot combo. I found with cards like curtain raiser and goblindbergh that yes you get an extra level 4 but unless you have enough dangers your plays pretty much stop there. 

The issue with second redoer is you only ever really touch it if you go into the full azathot combo and I found myself asking, even when running the trap, would I rather have another redoer or an abyss dweller or tornado dragon and the answer was almost always the other two. The issue with the trap as well is that you need to wait until your turn comes back around again to attach from your opponents gy and even then you're not guaranteed to pull off it's trap effect if your opponent has no traps where if you wanted the removal effect for sure you could just run castel. 

ED space is a little tight but I can definitely see thousand eyes fitting in there as removal I can then link away for other stuff. ","Seems pretty good, right now the deck is built around dropping the phantom knight stuff if I know I'm going second but I'll have to consider ","Thanks for responding!

I chose Space Insulator since he can be used with Mare Mare tokens and with the PK trap but its niche enough that underclock is probably better anyway.

I agree predaplants taking the normal summon sucks but by itself is a 1 card bardiche + redoer with another rank 4 available with just one more special summon and the trap. Kagetokage is probably a fine replacement however. 

I've gone back and forth between Bagooska and dark rebellion. Can't decide which is better than, Bagooska as you said helps with slow hands but dark rebellion is excellent for OTK potential. "," [**For a TL;DR and reference here's an image of the deck.**](https://imgur.com/a/6xyLp3L) 

#### Main 
**Monsters (26):**

* 3x Time Thief Regulator 
* 3x Time Thief Winder
* 2x Time Thief Bezel Ship

Time Thief package. Regulator is the Rescue Rabbit of your deck and your best normal summon. 

* 3x Danger! Mothman!
* 3x Danger! Chupacabra!

Small Danger! package. I'd run more if budget weren't an issue. Running Nessie lets you run Dark Grepher and do crazy stuff with that.

* 1x Armageddon Knight
* 1x Destrudo, the Lost Dragon's Frission
* 1x Mare Mare

Destrudo package. Gives access to Dawn Dragster going first and Mare Mare to make Borrelsword going second. 

* 1x The Phantom Knights of Silent Boots

I only run the one boots. In testing I found PKs to be slow and bricky, and even if you draw the boots you can special summon it while Bardiche is on the field then link it away to search Rank-Up-Magic. 

Now for the packages that'd be cut for more Dangers:

* 3x Predaplant Ophrys Scorpio
* 1x Predaplant Darlingtonia Cobra

Predaplant Engine to search Brilliant Fusion.

* 1x Performage Damage Juggler
* 1x Performage Trick Clown
* 1x Performage Hat Tricker

Performage Engine to send to GY off Brilliant Fusion and gain more special summons as a result.

* 1x Gem-Knight Garnet

And the one Garnet.

**Spells/Traps (12):**

* 3x Allure of Darkness

Most of the deck is dark and if you're running all the Dangers instead all of your deck is dark so Allure is an obvious choice.

* 3x Instant Fusion

Another free lv 4.

* 1x Reinforcement of the Army
* 1x Upstart Goblin
* 1x Foolish Burial
* 1x Monster Reborn

Just good cards and more extenders.

* 1x The Phantom Knights Rank-Up-Magic Launch

For Azathot.

**Traps (2):**

* 1x The Phantom Knights of Shade Brigandine
* 1x Phantom Knights' Fog Blade

Final part of the Phantom Knight Package. You could theoretically bump Fog Blade up to 3 and add an extra Boots and a Cloak but in testing I found this to be a little too slow.

Worth noting I don't run any of the Time Thief spell or trap cards because they're bad.

#### Extra

**Link (6):**

* 1x The Phantom Knights of Rusty Bardiche
* 1x Space Insulator

Bardiche is insane. I run Space Insulator over Underclock because sometimes you need to use the Trap or a Mare Mare Token to make it.

**Synchro (2):**

* 1x F.A. Dawn Dragster
* 1x Yazi, Evil of the Yang Zing

Yazi for Mare Mare shenanigans. Dragster is there for a S/T negate if you happen to draw Destrudo going first.

**Xyz (5):**

* 1x Time Thief Redoer
* 1x Outer Entity Azathot

Azathot package. Some people run two Redoers but I think without the trap to add materials to it its removal effect isn't consistent enough and I'd rather run a more impactful ED card, especially when space is tight.

* 1x Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
* 1x Tornado Dragon
* 1x Abyss Dweller

Dark Rebellion kills people. Tornado Dragon and Abyss Dweller are just good rank 4s.

**Fusion (2):**

* 1x Gem-Knight Seraphinite
* 1x Mudragon of the Swamp

Wrapping up the Extra Deck is the targets for Brilliant Fusion and Instant Fusion respectively.

#### Side

**Monsters (7):**

* 2x Destrudo, the lost Dragon's Fission
* 1x Dark Grepher

Going second you side out the PK stuff for these so you're more likely to draw into Destrudo for Yazi/Mare Mare shenanigans.

* 1x PSY-Frame Driver
* 3x PSY-Framegear Gamma

Gamma package.

**Spells (2):**

* 2x Twin Twister

Backrow hate for Striker/Altergeist and also Salamangreat.

**Traps (6):**

* 3x Gozen Match

Your deck is all dark so Gozen is a natural fit. It's relegated to the side however due to the deck's focus on comboing off but is good to side in in some matchups.

* 3x Red Reboot

A literal win button vs. Altergeist. You're trying to OTK going second with Borrelsword or Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon and this card prevents any and all of their disruption.

So that's the list. The general game-plan of the deck is to go first, combo into Azathot and then kill your opponent on the next turn. 

I've noticed with the lack of Dangers the deck sometimes lacks follow-up plays and falls flat to handtraps.

[**Finally, for reference, here's the deck as I would have built it given the budget.**](https://imgur.com/a/kTtZTGg)

DysthymicPrincess,"This past month I've been experiencing longer and more recurrent episodes of depersonalization coupled with derealization.

Five years have been enough for countless situations and verbal arguments to be twisted in the murky waters of two shattered memory banks along with the innate complexity of different human perspectives.

I underestimated greatly the creative force and to a certain extent, psychopathy that BPD drug addicts possess. The ones I know will deny severely their gaslighting, their attitude, and some other fun stuff but I still remember a life before I doubted daily my sanity -- completely aware of my own growing faults (as time passes it gets harder and harder to control my darkness, to make better decisions) so y'know, I can add 2+2 still, sometimes, thankfully. It's how I hold on to my mind.

Simply put, I'm completely drained and it's becoming more difficult each passing minute to keep my eternal depression functional even if I've already technically decided that if I ever get ahold of a shotgun it's bye bye, world.

I forgot who I was -- more importantly, I hate who I am. The world just doesn't look like the world I remember, rather a more hellish version... and realizing that the friends I thought I had was just an illusion hasn't helped, either. It's been two years since I've severed all ties. I have no one I can talk to in an emotional level: no friends, no family. I'm just miserable... Woe is me.",Agreed!,When acquiring already made crack for sell,"Oh!

Cuz why not,Dog!,"Wish this wasn't sober me, too","The scars are beginning to fade, cell after cell replacing with time a defective layer that hardly fulfilled its purpose. The curses are barely legible now, but the perpetrator remembers almost all of them. Sometimes she is too tired to recall them word for word, most of the day lying down on a soft bed, rolling around the soft green pebbles of bliss that she grinded earlier - too lazy to put away. 

Yet, other times she can remember the drowning sensation of the words she uttered twisting around her neck, every left becoming a right and and every wrong becoming another excuse. So why can't she remember where this path leads her? It's not like she's able to forget anything else.

The apple tree gives apples, the orange tree gives oranges and the addict give excuses.

Pain and shame was a reminder, but for each sigh of relief a smoky trap was left in place bit by bit stealing the little oxygen left. Tiredness becomes fatigue and memories instead of being a fact of time past transform into subjective scenarios from another's perspective. Black wasn't black, it was gray and you can't...

If theres grout haze or grout on the tiles themselves, there are products for helping loosen that up while you scrub. I haven't done a lot of that, so I don't have a specific product recommendation.

Older commodity OSB doesn't take fasteners well, and if it gets wet at all (spilled liquid, or moisture from below), it won't hold anything in place.

How cold will it get? Heaters and ac use a lot of energy, not something you can typically run off of a battery for any substantial space. If you're trying to stay warm, a car won't have much room, but that's to your advantage. Plus you can drive it to somewhere with a shower, if you have that option.

If you dont have a car, or already have some sort of container/tube/enclosure lined up, then I guess I'd say that ventilation is important (in a car, too, crack those windows!). You would want to cut some vents in, at least two for some airflow.
 If your structure is metal, be aware that the walls and ceiling will get wet. If you insulate them and air can still get to them, they will get even wetter. Its something you'll have to figure out how to deal with. Don't run any propane or kerosene Heaters in there, even if they seem super clean burning. Or if you absolutely have to, get a battery powered CO detector, make sure it works, and leave the door cracked open. But please don't. 

Whether or not batteries are a good option is going to depend on whether or not you can charge them easily. Start collecting blankets and sweaters.

You may want to tack up the right hand side piece plumb as well, and make sure there isn't a gap that you need to scribe to on that wall as well. Hopefully that makes sense.

For future reference, when I'm making frames like this, or fitting cabinet face frames into an alcove, ill typically tack up the outside stiles plumb first, scribe them, then tack them up again in their finished position.

I already have all my electives completed so it's not like I could do a semester of experimenting because the only classes I have left are ones for my major and minor. I've taken both an introductory sociology and introductory landscape architecture class as electives and I loved both of them. I really love the idea of studying humanity and its use of resources and how people and the environment interact. 

I don't know what to do. Please help.",No not really,Weight doesn’t just fall off.....that doesn’t help the depressive thoughts at all,I miss my shampoo and conditioner. The floor in the hotel is filled with sand. My depression and anxiety are terrible. Every interaction takes like 100% of my energy. I keep over thinking and over analyzing every single thing.

Dora_the_ho,"I think depression is killing my grades. Or maybe I'm just a lazy piece of shit that just procrastinates for the hell of it.

5. You came out of your mother's vagina with a bottle of Smirnoff.

_musiclover2020_,"Hey man, go easy on yourself. Covid has hit all of us hard this year. You're not alone in your struggles. Just hang in there.

On a practical  note, can you make it mandatory for your students to turn on their cameras and mics during your classes and encourage them to ask questions? Maybe they are getting negative vibes from you and they are either disinterested (due to your own low mood which could be affecting how you come across to your students) or scared/intimidated and don't want to speak up. I'm just hazarding a guess here.

Do speak to a therapist if you can. Alternately, is there another trusted teacher you can talk to? Maybe they might be having similar experiences?

Previously, I always added water to the pellets but now that the weather is getting warmer (I'm in the southern hemisphere so we're getting close to summer), I had to stop wetting the pellets because the food was starting to spoil after a few hours.

My quails seem to either be not eating, or eating a lot less than they used to. Should I wait and see if they will start eating the dry pellets? I'm not sure if they are having trouble swallowing the pellets, they are just standard game bird pellets and should be small enough for them to swallow. Do you think it would help if I ground the pellets into a powder? I used to do that when they were chicks but now they are 6 months old and I think they should be able to swallow them whole.

Old_Soul_98,"I feel so hopeless at times.. i feel as if i don’t have any meaningful talents. People always tell me how personable i am and how empathetic i am. That’s nice and all but.. being a nice and empathetic person doesn’t exactly get you anywhere in this life. I wish i was good with computers, or cars, or home renovation, or anything.. I do well in school but it’s a major struggle for me. My anxiety and depression eat me alive. I’m studying to become a teacher as i want to help others, but i still don’t even feel confident in my field. It’s so intimidating being around those who are so knowledgeable and hardly give any effort. I’m just not wired like that.. I’m a deep thinker and i always over complicate things. I just feel hopeless sometimes.. i want a purpose and i want the confidence to move forward in this life. My confidence is just shot.. I’m afraid I’ll be a failure and a bum on the streets with no job, no home, and no relationship. I can hardly handle what I’m doing now.. aghhhh! I just want to scream sometimes","I’m a college student and as i get further into my major and higher level courses, I’m noticing that i just NEVER have time anymore. I get up at 7:30-8 ish and work on assignments until around 8-9 PM. It never used to be this way. I can’t tell if it’s my anxiety that’s telling me that I’m too busy, or if it’s just the reality of my situation. My workload just feels insane. When i felt it was too much, my advisor basically said that in order to stay in my specific program i had to be in all these courses. So.. dropping courses isn’t an option. Maybe i take school too seriously.. I’m terrified of failing out. My mind always goes to worst case scenario and maybe i just spend too much time on papers and readings that others blow off. Idk. It genuinely feels as if i have no time, but is this all in my head?? Is anyone else in this boat? I constantly see friends on Snapchat or on social media at bars and parties and I’m like... how in the hell do you not have a million things to do for school?! It can be frustrating. I don’t mind working hard and busting my ass but dang.. I’d enjoy a night or two of relief a week.","Even after accomplishing a task or succeeding on an assignment or project, the relief and happiness is so temporary. It’s driving me INSANE. i always find something new to stress about. Even after I’ve proven to myself a million times that I’m capable of handling things, the anxiety is still as powerful as it always has been when i face new challenges. It’s hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.. is there even a light? Life seems to be a constant battle.. there’s always a new challenge or situation or assignment and damn... it can feel monotonous. My anxiety makes me so tired. I’m always on fight or flight. I just want to be happy. I just want to be okay with the possibility that i will fail at times and have the confidence to move forward. The way I’m living is just no way to live life. I don’t want to be on my deathbed regretful of the time I’ve wasted miserable and anxious. Yet here i am.. miserable and anxious. It’s so hard sometimes. It’s like I’m looking for an answer I’ll never find...","Absolutely. It’s everything i wish i could say to them. I want to be better for them, and I’m going to continue to try to be better everyday even though it’s an immense struggle.","Dear Family and Friends,

I am told i am not supposed to apologize for the way i am. I am told my brain has a chemical imbalance, making it near impossible for me to function at times. I am told, reassured, and supported. What more could i ask? Yet, i do want to apologize. For many things. Things i despise about myself; things that i unintentionally do. For the nights i don’t respond to text messages and leave those that care about me worried sick, i am sorry. I am sorry that i stare off into space in the middle of conversation. I am sorry i overreact to trivial situations, as they feel so real and so terrifying to me. I am sorry i pass up invitations to go on trips, to the gym, and to the bars; as i am too anxious to feel as if i can handle it. I am sorry i bring those around me down. I am sorry i withdraw when asked “what’s wrong?” I am sorry i snap when i am under pressure and stressed. I am sorry that it may seem as if i believe my problems are larger than anyone else’s. They are not, larger than anyone else’s; my reaction to these problems just happen to be larger than anyone else’s. I am sorry i can’t get out of this rut. I am sorry for the worry and the tears that i bring upon my family, as they hurt so deeply and wish nothing but happiness for me. I am sorry for apologizing, as I’ve promised I’d stop apologizing for who i am. I feel so guilty for who i am. 

Sincerely, 

                Your son, brother, and friend","First off i just want to say how great this community has been and I’m thankful for the wonderful people that have given me advice and have shared their experiences similar to the struggles i face. To everyone out there struggling and still finding time to reach out and help me, you’re the best. My point of this post is just to vent and be heard.. and to show others out there that they’re not alone if they feel the world caving in on them. 

Sometimes i just wonder if I’m going to make it.. i feel as if though it only gets harder going forward and that creates immense anxiety for me. God.. i just miss being happy and carefree. I used to be that person.. it almost makes me tear up thinking about how much I’ve changed in the past 5 years.. in ways i don’t like. I know life is hard and it’s not supposed to be easy, but I’m crawling out of my skin all hours of the day. Anxiety and depression are so intense.. i feel as if I’m living a different life some days. I’m just tired.. like i know most people out there are. It’s hard enough doing what you have to do on a regular basis, but it’s even more difficult when you’re fighting the inner voice that’s telling you that you’re worthless, weak, undeserving. After so long you believe it. You start to identify with what your mind is telling you. I’ll keep fighting because i know i don’t have any other choice.. I’m just losing hope. I’m afraid I’ll always be this way. I just want to make my family proud and one day support a wife and kids of my own. Yet, I’m afraid that I’m not capable of it due to my anxiety and depression. It just makes me feel even more anxious/depressed. I don’t ever expect anxiety or the depression to go away completely.. i just hope it gets more manageable as i continue to push harder and go to therapy and take my medication. I’m trying to do all the right things.. i just wish I’d see some results or improvement. I feel lost.","Thank you for this. I really do appreciate it. Last week, i reached out to my doctor about the anxiety and have started taking medication for it as well as incorporating meditation, reading, and exercise in my daily routine. Also, i started seeing a therapist 2-3 weeks ago, but I’ve never mentioned these concerns. I’ll make it a priority to moving forward in order to work on myself. Thanks again.","Anxiety is real.. and if it happens again with the next guy, just remember that it’s okay. It’s hard not to beat ourselves up, but cut yourself a break and remember that eventually you DID get comfortable. That’s so awesome! Think about it; you overcame this anxiety despite how strong it was. Remember that you can do this again! A huge step is simply recognizing you feel this way, which you have. You’ve recognized that you get very anxious in these new situations with intimacy, and this recognition will help you moving forward. Since you know this about yourself, do not be afraid to be honest with him. He may be feeling anxious too, and this mutual feeling might help both of you and take the pressure off. You’ve got this, and i wish the best for you!","I definitely understand this. For me, it’s emails. They’re an immediate trigger for me. I have people emailing me 1000x a day needing this, or needing that, or reminding me of this or that. It’s exhausting sometimes. Notifications don’t allow use to separate ourselves from outside sources and i feel a lot of people need this separation. Maybe try setting some limits. After your day is done, put your phone on do not disturb or set your phone to a specific ringtone for loved ones. Unless it’s that ringtone, leave the phone be, or put it in another room. Lately I’ve been doing this with emails. Once 6 PM hits I’m done. I turn my notifications off for email and it’s helped tremendously. I understand texts and calls can be different though. But it might not hurt to try!","This is more than okay. Listen, as a 22 year old male, I take things pretty slow and also feel intense anxiety around women (especially if i really like them). Honestly, i love taking things slow. I want it to MEAN something. I think today and the way society functions, we are expected to just give it out like Halloween candy and not think another second about it. This is not how it has to be. I also have really bad anxiety, and i get really worried that it’ll turn women off or they’ll lose interest in me or think I’m weak etc.. but there are many men and women in this same boat . Be yourself (this is cheesy i know). Seriously though, i respect women like you and people that actually CARE. Dont get me wrong, it sucks that you feel anxious; anxiety is a terrible feeling. But it only means that you take life seriously and care. A mature, respectful guy will admire this. If not, he’s not worth the time or he’s not your type of person. Hang in there. You’re not alone and this is okay and more common than you think.","Hi guys, I’m a 22 year-old male in college with intense anxiety. I was in a relationship for 3 year’s (17-20 years old), and I’m finding myself really wanting something again. The problem is, I’m always really busy and i have really bad anxiety. It’s a little demoralizing because i feel I’m a very empathetic person and i care about people a lot. yet i feel I’m not able to be that support for someone that they truly need and want.

I swear, i can be a lot of fun and I’m always told that I’m funny, caring, smart, etc.. I just don’t always feel that i am, and sometimes i have bad days and need reassurance or just someone to talk to about issues I’m dealing with. I feel that no woman would want a guy like this.. and it’s a hard reality to face. 

I hate showing weakness.. i know that it sounds bad, but i feel that I’ll never be able to have a relationship because im just not mentally strong enough. Women want a guy that’s confident, can provide, and someone that just makes them feel as if everything will be okay. I used to be able to be this guy.. and now i just don’t feel like i can be. When me and my ex of 3 years split, it was around the same time my anxiety and depression got bad. I’ve never admitted this, but it killed me and was devastating. I really needed someone to be there for me and i felt as if i did a great job being someone she could come to on a regular basis. But, when i needed her, i feel like she saw me as weak and she lost attraction to me. It hurt..

Let me be clear though, looking back i realize that it was probably best. It’s not like i miss her (anymore) and she’s moved on and moved halfway across the country (which definitely made the break up easier). I just.. feel as if I’m the reason it happened. I feel like people really like me until they see my weak side, and then they’re turned off and become distant. 

Idk what to do.. maybe i should just wait until I’m out of school and my life is a little more clear. At the same time, i miss that connection. I miss caring for someone and all the great things that come with it. I’ve just lost my confidence.. and anytime a girl shows interest in me these days I’m very quick to retreat or become distant before anything serious happens. I hate that i do this, but i feel it’s a defense mechanism and I’m almost avoiding it because i feel that they’ll just lose interest in me like my last gf did. 

Sorry for such a long post, i just need some advice. Has any other guy felt this way? I’m envious of those that have confidence all the time. What do women think? I’m i just not cut out for relationships?","One of my best friends is in Med School and the stories i hear I’m like.. holy shit i could never. Yet, he’s so chill and never worried. It amazes me. I’m with you.. wish so badly i was like that sometimes. I’m over here getting stressed over nothing","Hey everyone, 

Lately, I’ve been struggling immensely with my anxiety and depression. It started 5 years ago, and for awhile it really got better. Now.. I’ve hit rock bottom. College has been miserable to say the least. I’m drowning in readings, essays, papers, etc.. I’m so fed up with it and everyday i just feel like quitting. The temptation is so real sometimes. I feel hopeless.. like I’m just never going to get any relief in this life. COVID has made college and my workload 10x worse, and I’ve been so busy and overwhelmed with coursework that I’ve been skipping meals and not doing the small things that help me because I’ve convinced myself that i do not have the time. Is school and my career so important that i have to be miserable at all hours of the day? My favorite part of day is.. the end of it. I’ve never looked forward to going to bed more than i have this year. It’s a temporary escape, and also a double edged sword bc the anxiety of the next day just creeps in as i lay in bed. I’m tired of living like this.. it’s a living hell. 

Sometimes i feel like no one can understand it. The anxiety is so intense and the depression is so deep.. i feel like I’m dying sometimes. I want it to stop. I want to be happy like i used to be. I want to have the damn time to go out with friends and not feel the creeping anxieties about my work and the fact that I’m going to be even further behind if I’m not grinding 24/7. My mental health has deteriorated so much in the last 2 months. 

I’m sorry to complain.. i get that complainers are annoying and just bring others down.. I’m just scared. I’m frustrated. I know that i love life.. i always used to. I just forget what that feeling is like and it’s scary. I want to be a normal college student again. I want to be excited about my future rather than dreading it because it feels as if it’ll be just like my life is right now. 

I don’t even know what the point of this post is.. i just feel alone. I want to truly live again. I miss it. I’m tired of being afraid.. I’m just tired of being tired.","Just wanted you to know you’re not alone. I’ve been struggling with that a lot lately. I’m trying to do all of the “right things” but i can’t lie, it’s still been a massive struggle. By right things i mean: Meditating, going to a therapist, taking antidepressants, getting outside, studying my ass off, etc.. 

It’s sucks because even though I’m doing all of these things, i still have a very difficult time manifesting happiness. I try to find little things throughout the day that make me happy but it’s tough.. the anxiety can be debilitating and it’s hard not to get frustrated or pissed off when you’re trying your best and still hardly getting by. 

All i can say is; keep pushing forward. Find those little things everyday that make you smile. Whatever they may be. I try to remind myself that i only get one shot in this life and i don’t want to spend my time worrying and stressing over things that don’t mean much in the grand scheme of life.  I want to look back someday and know that despite the struggles that i endured, i found a way to be happy and to find meaning in life. Find a way to help someone everyday. No matter what that looks like. I promise you, that’s what life is all about. Being there for others and constantly trying to make the lives of others better. To me, that’s what makes this life worth it. I love helping people, and i love the “small things” in life like seeing a little boy and his dog playing in the yard and the pure happiness and euphoria that it brings him. It gives me hope, even if that sounds crazy.

There’s a quote that i always go back to, and it’s simple but i feel that it carries a lot of significance. The quote is: “when you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.” I love this quote because i feel it’s so true. It’s all about our perspective and how we look at things in life. We can’t look for the negatives in a situation or circumstance because it’s all that we will see. Instead, we have to look for the good, no matter how cliche it sounds. Good luck, i know you can do it. We all can.","What you just described is so similar to what I’ve been feeling it’s almost scary. Last night i had a full blown panic attack for the first time in my life. I’m a college student and I’m 22 in my 4th year with one more year to complete my degree. I drove all the way home last night because i knew i was spiraling and i needed to be home. I kid you not, i sobbed like a child when i got home and told my parents that i just couldn’t do it anymore. My fear is paralyzing. The thought of starting the day almost sends me over the edge. The second i wake up it’s immense panic and catastrophe is everywhere i look. It feels like there’s no escape. I love life too, but not like this. This is pure misery. 

You’re not alone. That might not help the way you feel right now, but it’s so true. Today i reached out to my doctor and told him exactly what i feel and how i can’t take it anymore. It’s hard to be honest and admit that you’re spiraling, but sometimes it’s necessary. I’m going to try therapy again and continue to take antidepressants for awhile as well as Ativan (only for the panic attacks). 

Don’t lose hope in this life. Ask for help. Talk to a friend and make a plan! If you’re anything like me, it’s going to feel overwhelming at first. I’m overwhelmed just talking about it now. But, we owe it to ourselves and we deserve to live a better life than this. You can do this. You have intrinsic value and you are stronger and smarter than you believe. One step forward. Take each day 5 minutes at a time. One step. 5 minutes at a time. Tomorrow’s worries will always be there. Worry about today. 5 minutes at a time. 

I’ve had intense anxiety for 5 years now, and I’ve been off and on medication and in and out of therapy. It’s not an easy fight, but i promise you that you’re not alone and you CAN handle this world. It’s hard to see others live life so carefree and so easily, but just remember that you are not them and maybe they struggle with something and just tend to hide it well. I know many people that struggle tremendously, yet they seem as if they’re on top of the world. 

Keep pushing along. Remember that some days you will feel weaker than others and that’s okay. You can only give so much. I truly hope things get better for you. Don’t give up on yourself. You deserve to be happy. Never forget that."
Chorizo1993,"My wife and I were so excited to announce her pregnancy with our third child. We went to the first appointment and ran all the basic tests. Turns out she was almost seven weeks. Everything came back normal and so we decided to tell our family. We surprised our kids, parents, grandparents, closest friends and then the rest of the family. Two days later she started bleeding at work. I rushed to the hospital and they said it was most likely a second gestational sac that wasn’t viable. So we kept an eye on it because the doctors told us she could bleed throughout the pregnancy and still carry the child. The next day, she miscarried our son. We never got to a point of finding out the gender but we had this sure feeling it was a boy. We went to the hospital and did a sonogram which showed that it was the a miscarriage. The doctor asked me if I wanted to bring the fetus in be tested to find out why. I went back to the house and put him in a box that I used for my watches since it was the only one that was the right size. I drove him to the hospital and sat in the waiting room holding and staring at the box for almost an hour. I replayed what I had seen and done over and over in my head. I’ve had nightmares almost every night and can’t be in a quiet place for long before I start freaking out. I’m putting on a mask of strength everyday to help my wife and kids cope with the loss but I’m falling apart on the inside. I don’t know what to do.

Sometimes it is harder to build mass with calisthenics compared to weight lifting but for everything you said it is ideal. 

As for incorporating dumbbells there are lots of exercises you can do (like dumbbell press and curl) and I’m sure a quick google would give you better info than I could on that.

It’s awesome that you have a pull up bar. Use that for chin ups pull up and holds. Basically the #1 back exercise at your disposal.

Also you can train your central nervous system through isometric exercises, which basically just means practicing holds (like chin up holds or planks). These are really good for building strength but you want to go easy on them so you don’t overload your cns. Muscle recovers within days but if you push your cns too far it can leave you feeling sore for a while.

Anyways hope this information helps, if you have any questions I’d be free to help. I’m by no means an expert I’m just really into calisthenics.","Calisthenics are the way to go. What i would recommend:

Chest: pushups (wide, triangle, shoulder, jump clap, incline, decline), dips (straight bar dips, regular dips, seated dips)

Back: Superman pose, chin ups and pull-ups (If you have a bar), body row

Legs: body weight squats, one legged squats, sumo squats, side to side squats, bridges, one leg bridges, lunges

Abs: flutter kicks, lower ab kick, leg raises, crunches, boats, move your legs in a circle while keeping your body planted, and there are lots of other that you can easily find online

That’s about it, just note that a lot of these exercises already utilize your abs so there is no need to go too hard with abs. Also you should start with largest muscle groups first, so it should go:  legs, back, chest, abs

I would recommend doing all muscle groups in one day with 2-3 exercises minimum for each muscle group. Give yourself a day to recover and more if you feel like you need it (especially starting off it will be a lot on your cns).

Eat lots of protein and it wouldn’t hurt to have some carbs like a banana thirty min before the workout. 

Focus on consistently maxing out. For instance, you shouldn’t set a specific amount of reps for your pushups but rather do 5xmax. Or at least have the last two sets be to max. So you can do 3x20 and then 2xmax which may be more. This ensures progressive overload which is necessary for building muscle. 

Just realize that calisthenics takes a level of mental toughness but will reward you with more proportional strength and physique than strength training.",Who gonna stop me from using it huh?

This way dna would still be delivered into cells and possibly utilized.,"A question I have been playing around with for a while: so non-replicating viruses such as lentivirus are traditionally used to administer DNA in the CRISPR process. Is it possible to use a replicating virus to administer DNA, perhaps one that has a gene encoding for the production of CAS-9 protein so it can slice and dice at the same time?

I know if this is possible it would result in a menagerie of off target effects and the likelihood of mutations. But just imagine if this is possible, how it could essentially cause widespread genetic change throughout an entire organism?

Normal_Newspaper6278,"Recently, my doctor prescribed me some anti-depressants. Prozac IIRC. TBH I was only calling because I wanted an ADHD related prescription but I'm too much of a coward to directly ask for one.

I'm currently seeing a therapist but it's not going well. I really don't want to take anti-depressants, I've heard too many bad things about them to consider the risk being worth it. The risk of weight gain is a huge turn of for me.

The thing is that therapy isn't doing much for me. I don't know if there's anything a therapist can tell me that I'd buy into anymore. My current therapist isn't too good either.

BTW I do exercise frequently and try to get outside. I just don't feel like anything helps that much. Like I'm trying to trick my mind but my mind knows my own playbook and isn't stupid.

Most of my regrets are related to my university degree and how I struggle to keep trying when I've failed a lot in life despite getting my BA and MA.","I (25m) have started seeing a not great therapist because I've been feeling not great mentally since graduating with my MA in poli sci last year. So far she hasn't been too useful. She doesn't get how not useful an MA or BA are. Moreover, when I told her I can't get myself to apply for jobs she doesn't really help me that much. She just tells me to apply for jobs which I find fucking useless because if I could do that I wouldn't need her. TBH I think I might have ADHD that's just misdiagnosed. 

What is a therapist going to do that's so useful?

I feel condemned to amount to little to nothing rn and I don't know how therapy is realistically going to help me overcome never being able to get anywhere because of my lower middle class background and just being on the outside all the time. I never felt treated to well for most of university and I don't have too many useful qualifications to move forward career wise.

I'm not sure any therapist, even an understanding one can help me very much.

 Should I just stick to cigarettes, alcohol and try drugs? I don't feel like there's anything useful anyone can say to me at this point?","I agree. It sucks talking to the therapist I’m currently seeing is trying to tell me university is over which it is but in some ways what I was expecting to get out of university never happened and imo it’s hard for therapsids to competently relate to someone who is lower middle class when they are probably working a decent middle class job and are solidly employed, or come from a decent background to see them. They don’t see the dynamics of class or if they do they don’t know what to do about feeling constantly self aware because 4+ years drilled it into your head.

Therapy won’t make me believe in myself as much as getting a more useful degree or lucking out into a decent job. Hell even some better dating prospects would help a lot rn. I’m 25 and I feel like I’m a bitter, cynical 17 year old who will never experience things in life but no one has the time of day to seriously listen to and believe me.

Lastly, I think therapists don’t get the emotional toll of how constantly failing wears down on you mentally. Like, no lady I’m not just going to apply for jobs and hope I get something anymore when I’ve been broken down by years of rejection among my peers. Like, I think it’s something therapy can help if done properly but you need to understand it well before you can help people with such issues.",Doesn’t mean you have to stalk people,"Thanks for the kind words! Tbh I’d feel a lot better if people were genuinely sympathetic and acknowledged that it’s pretty hard for people like me and you. 

Like the if you’re from a better off background you’re a lot more likely to succeed if you keep trying. It’s not quite the case if you don’t come from that sort of background.

Best wishes to you in life",Still trolling I see,Don’t stalk me buddy,"Idk I just went because my mom emotionally manipulated me into getting a degree and I didn’t have he 12 math so that limited my options. I wish I went to school for finance or engineering but it’s too late because of student debt. Also, I can’t mentally really handle more school rn.

I was hoping to become a policy analyst, some other sort of civil service employee or a police officer but all of those jobs have thousands of applicants for hundreds of positions and I’m never going to be anything special. It doesn’t help that I kills myself mentally to get through university. Also, a lot of the people from my university came from higher off backgrounds and didn’t talk to me because I was a commuter townie basically",Back under your bridge troll,Are you projecting your insecurities on to me?,"Well said. I think another part is short sightedness in the sense that some people either have a decent job or know someone with one and don’t know what happened to all the rejects. Out of sight out of mind.

Also, why acknowledge hard truths when you can just say other people have a ‘victim mentality’ and call it a day? What’s empathy. Jk","Agreed. It’s not easy to accept that no matter what one can do there’s a lot of things that you can’t control in life or have little control over.

It’s like what Marx said, men are free but not in circumstances of their choosing. Or a something like that anyways.

For me, it’s frustrating how I went to the same university as other people and while some of them got nice government summer jobs or internships or into nice programs, I could never amount to anything despite doing relatively the same thing.

Rn I feel really uncomfortable around solid middle class wealth because no matter what I seem to do it never works and now I’m at the point where I’d rather not try than continue to try and get nowhere. It’s hard to apply for jobs where you know you’re not close to being well qualified.

I think part of what you’re referring to has been called the “just world hypothesis” where people think good things happen to good, deserving people and as a result they rationalize where they are and hate people who contradict their beliefs out of some insecurity.

I just wish people would admit that life is really hard and sometimes you’ll go nowhere. It’s like everyone has some solution that’s just bound to work but when it doesn’t work or underperforms  they never apologize for giving  you that advice or admit that they could be wrong.

Idk, my life for the most part has sucked for one reason or another and I just can’t dig my way out of it. Not too many people acknowledge that being lower middle class with an hard to pronounce ethnic first name doesn’t help.

Rn it just feels like it’s hard to believe in future success when you’ve never had any. Not too many folks ever acknowledge that.  Like how many times do you never get what you want before. 

Tbh I don’t think therapy or meds would ever work for me. They can’t change where you’re at in life.

Thanks so much for the kind and astute response","Maybe. They’ve told me basically the same thing when I wasn’t unemployed for a while. It’s really more when I ask for advice on Reddit but my aunt is like that too.

I agree, people just figure that they somehow got a job so you must somehow be able to as well. Survivor bias I guess. It doesn’t help that I never fit in at university so a lot of people don’t get being lower middle class or don’t get that just because they got out means I ever can.

Lastly, I think some people find job postings online and don’t get the loads of applicants applying for those jobs.",I’m sorry to hear that :( not fitting in really sucks in life and the people who do fit in have no idea what it’s like and often little sympathy,I’m not but thanks for assuming I’m a jerk,"FWIW, I can’t really find a new place to fit at home. I’ve just been unemployed for a year and I lack practical skills. FWIW, I’ll try to get to a better place if I ever stop feeling like life is over for me

Also, my family doesn’t get angry at it but refuses to acknowledge it and I find when I look for some sort of support on Reddit I don’t get it too often. Looking at r/grad school.","LOL, probably. People don’t like bleak and overwhelming truths. 

I’m pretty sure on a side note, that the people I went to university with wouldn’t say they had no time of day for me but that doesn’t make it true. It just sucks because I don’t have anything left mentally or emotionally anymore to give but I don’t have a great future. It also sucks that I was raised to aspire for middle class goals and I’d rather kill myself than accept significantly less. It’s just one of the few things I have left.

Maybe if my social and dating life were better it’d be a different story","Thanks. I just wish it didn’t break me
I’m the process. I don’t think I can ever get out of where I’m at.",It depends are you a fake Marxist in university or a real one? We have to know,"I come from a lower middle class background and despite going to university (BA and MA in poli sci). I commuted and hour by city bus each way and tbh I just felt alienated from my peers for most of university. I just felt very self aware and class conscious. I really struggled to make friends or get dates as a commuter student.

Hell, university broke me down so much I’ve just been unemployed for a year since graduating. As well, I always weirdly seem to miss out on good summer job opportunities other people had.

When I try telling some people this they get weirdly angry at me for some reason. Why is this?

I’m not saying people can’t rise beyond the lower middle class but statistically speaking anyone is far more likely to stay in it than leave.

Thanks so much for getting back to me I appreciate it a lot.",Like that there are a lot of people in general who do this or a lot of people with narcissistic tendencies?,"I have a cousin who is sort of similar. Sucks to hear. I hate people who have decent to even good lives but instead just complain and put others down all the time. They are truly pathetic. What's worse is that a lot of the people around them, especially those who might hold a bit more authority over them never call them out on their crap and refuse to deal with them or punish them for doing so.

For example, that cousin of mine basically insulted my alma matter when I was grabbing lunch with him, my uncle (his dad), my other uncle, and my brother and while I just left an awkward silence. In hindsight, I'm thinking shouldn't someone like my cousin's dad have stepped in and told him not to do that sort of crap? I'd never talk to anyone like that. My mom tried telling me I was too sensitive. 

It sucks because a lot of narcs have family members or friends who enable their behavior and buy into their victimization attitude and never call them out. Also, said cousin is kind of racist and complains about people ripping off welfare programs but has no objections to taking them."

Wait did this really happen? What episode did the theorem appear in?","A lot of people have recommended books, so I figure I'll list some of the best comics, in chronological order of their setting:

*Dawn of the Jedi*: Set tens of thousands of years before literally any other Star Wars material, it tells the origin story of the Jedi Order on Tython, and of the Rakatan Infinite Empire. It was really good and had some interesting ideas, but it's been a while since I've read it, so I can't remember too much off the top of my head. Jedi fought with regular swords and guns shot bullets, though. Also interstellar travel wasn't really a thing yet.

*Tales of the Jedi*: A must-read. Taking place between 4,000 and 3,980 years before the original trilogy, it follows the tragic fall and redemption of the Jedi Knight/Sith Lord known as Ulic Qel-Droma. Another Sith who appears in it, Exar Kun, also makes an important appearance in the *Jedi Academy* trilogy of books. There's a couple arcs that are even more prequely and take place a thousand years before the Ulic Qel-Droma/Nomi Sunrider story and feature the Daragon siblings and Naga Sadow; you can safely skip those.

*Knights of the Old Republic*: Bridging the gap between *Tales of the Jedi* and the video game of the same name, it features Zayne Carrick as a padawan caught in a conspiracy, having been framed for killing four of his fellow padawans by their masters. It is a very good series. It is not necessary to have read *Tales* nor played the video game to enjoy this comic, though it does add to it.

*Knight Errant*: A personal favourite of mine, and one of the most highly underrated Star Wars comics of all time. Its star is Kerra Holt, a Jedi Knight thirty years before Darth Bane created the Rule of Two fighting deep in the territory of the Sith Empire. Her two main enemies are the brothers Lord Odion and Lord Daimon, who are really interesting. Personally, I love the setting and [wrote a whole thing about how I really want to know more about the New Sith Wars](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsEU/comments/g1demp/why_the_new_sith_wars_are_awesome_and_underrated/), so I won't repeat myself too much, just know that I very highly recommend it.

*Republic*: Probably the grittiest, most brutal portrayal of the Clone Wars that I've ever read, and it is absolutely amazing. I will forever point to the Battle of Jabiim arc as one of my favourite Star Wars stories of all time. Also really good are Quinlan Vos's arc, Anakin's arc (especially his interactions with A'Sharrad Hett) and everything that Ventress is in.

*Darth Vader*: Anything with Darth Vader in its title is good. The 2015 series took place between ANH and ESB, the 2017 series shortly after RotS and features some really interesting character development. *Darth Vader and the Ghost Prison* is about an attempted coup against Palpatine, and Vader gets a bunch of war criminals to help retake the empire.

*X-Wing: Rogue Squadron*: Taking place shortly after the Battle of Endor and starring Wedge Antilles and his squadron, it paints a nice picture of the political situation right as the New Republic rises to power. It also explores to a lesser extent the dynamic of a post-Palpy empire, with first Sate Pestage at the head of the empire and then a takeover by Ysanne Isard.

*Dark Empire*: Palpy is back, and he's cloned. This series can be rather bonkers to read, especially *DE2* and *Empire's End*, but it is really interesting. I think that the first Dark Empire is unironically a good comic series even if the later two are really only good for camp, but I still recommend reading it.

*Crimson Empire*: You know those red dudes who stood around Palpy as his bodyguards? This series is about one of them, on a quest for revenge against the man who betrayed the Emperor. Kir Kanos is a rather different Star Wars protagonist, and he's an enemy of both the New Republic and the Empire. It relies a tiny bit on lore from *Dark Empire* and I don't want to spoil it too much, but trust me, this series is one of the best Star Wars comics.

*Legacy*: Chronologically the furthest thing in the future of Star Wars, it takes place over a hundred years after even the Yuuzhan Vong War and features Cade Skywalker as a protagonist, who struggles with both the pull to the dark side and a crippling drug addiction. I would probably suggest reading *Republic* first, as it sets up a couple characters, but it's not necessary at all - you'll figure out who K'Kruhk and T'ra Saa are from context. I find it quite interesting - the protagonist is different, the political factions are different and the Sith are quite different from what we've seen in previous eras of Star Wars.

This is mostly EU material, but some of the Darth Vader comics I mentioned are in the Disney canon.",[Beginning of the End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlGreReJa24) by The Softies.,"> To put it in newer perspective- seven year olds never knew a world pre-Frozen.

It really does freak me out that little kids these days will see Frozen as just another timeless Disney classic, in the same way that I viewed movies like the Lion King or Aladdin. And then I realize that people just a decade or two older than I am wouldn't see the Lion King and Aladdin as existing in that timeless way that I do, but rather as distinct products of their time that were released in their lives.",">What was the point of Padan Fain? He has been an antagonist since book 1 and the series built up so much that he hated Rand and would destroy him. Then he show up for like 2 chapters and May kills him no problem super easy.

I think that when Robert Jordan died he didn't have enough notes about Padan Fain for Brandon Sanderson to wrap up his storyline properly. I wish I could say that there was more to it than that, but I think that that's it.","In what way did the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic influence the results of the 2020 election?

Then I threw it away and, lo and behold, it showed up the next morning as well to scare the shit out of me when I awoke. I ended up giving it to a friend as a moving-away present, but for something like the last week that I knew him he was complaining to me about how creepy he thought the furby was. I haven't heard anything from him since we were kids.",This comment wasn't amazing either though.,"I imagine it would work no differently to human societies. I know more bisexual people than straight people, personally, and most of the people I thought were straight were closet bisexuals.

I imagine there would be some societal impetus to encourage heterosexual relations, monogamous or not, for the purposes of procreation. I know of many human cultures where you're expected to be monogamous in your heterosexuality, but homosexual activity outside of that monogamy does not count as adultery, for example. I know of others where there's both a socially acceptable monogamous heterosexual partner and a socially acceptable monogamous homosexual partner - for instance, in ancient Athens, a man would have a wife and could also have a ~~fuckboy~~ erastes or an eromos. In Christendom, bi people were just forced into heteronormative roles.

Also lots of bi people are in long-term, healthy, loving, monogamous relationships with people of the other gender."
ibangurwife69,"Hi it’s my first time writing here, I just saw this subreddit, and the amount of posts and people that have the same feelings and thoughts as I have is mind-blowing to me. I swear, it could’ve been me writing them. 


I am 22 years old, and only very recently I’ve realized I have depression. I am a religious person to an extent. I believe in an afterlife, that’s the main reason I still want to live. I also want to say that I’m thankful that my mom and dad are alive, my brothers and sisters, and a few friends. I am more thankful now because I know some, if not many, of y’all don’t have all that. To those, I hope you find someone who could help you. At the same time, you don’t exactly need someone, sometimes people have the opposite effect. Or what is called, social imposition. 

I cannot speak of my depression to any of my family and friends. That is because in the society that I live in, it is unheard of. It is considered a lazy excuse for not doing your hardest. I know for a fact that some of my family will immediately think that I’m actually doing drugs or something. Some others would seem understanding and helping but their thoughts of me would be “what a shame” “ is he that weak?” “Wow is he even a normal guy”. 

In one month, it will have been one year since I stopped college. I have only barely finished my sophomore. I have below zero energy to continue studying even though I don’t exactly find my major difficult. For one full year, I had no desire in living. I don’t want to “die” either, I want to barely be able to live. If I could have the bare minimum food and water, with some safe place to lay my head and sleep. That’s all I can ask for. I always had the thought of suddenly being in a different country. I’d just find any type of work that could get me my bread and water. I would be living the dream. I have released myself from any aspirations, if I can barely live while I help the people I can help, I think I would be at my happiest. 

I am not used to expressing my emotions and thoughts. I have the belief that It’s better to keep it between myself and my god. However, since it’s anonymous, I wrote this post to share it with others who might be in the same boat as I am. I got great relief reading posts and comments that I share with. 

Finally, I want to say that if your case is similar to mine, let’s hope for a better future. And to those who have no family or friends, or who have lost dear people to their hearts, I can’t imagine how hard you’re having it. I can only say I hope all of us get through it. If you are also feeling extremely lonely on top of the depression, try and look for God. If you try to find Allah, he will find you. If you have no idea what I’m talking about it, just try searching in the internet for comforting quotes in any religion. I don’t know if it will do anything, but I just want to share what I have that could might help.",Plot double-triple-twist: The delivery guy was his ex girl but now is a trans -hence Jake-because the dude is actually gay but doesn’t realize it yet.,"Fair point. But, I’m not talking about the entity God, yet. However, take all of the known universe (planets, galaxies, stars, ...etc), they are existences that we know for sure are not created by us humans. We also have no clue of other intellectual/powerful beings that could possibly be the creators behind those. Yet, through science, we now realise how majestic and immaculately detailed they are and their systems. Based on that, would you say that it is also fair for people to assume there is an able creator, just as fair for other people to assume that there is no god because there is no evidence for it?","Would you agree that, at the same time, we cannot say for sure that there is no god?","Heyy, I would like to know more about how you’ve come to be an atheist. I’m interested in the how more than the why, but would love to know anything you can share. I don’t mean to disturb you, but I’m really interested.",She kinda hot,"Bro I can believe Kaido being the weakest, I’m just saying nothing yet is clear to us.",Yes it matters. You wanna tell me that Garp and Reyleigh are as strong as they were 30 years ago? No way dude. Kaido was an apprentice when he was in Rocks’s. He was probably 10-15 years old.,"It’s very safe to assume Kaido was not in his prime 20 years ago, and that Oden was in his prime. Also, we should all agree that prime WB> all Yonko, therefore Oden obviously had no chance against whitebeard. Plus, I’m willing to believe that neither Roger nor WB dared to go into war against the other. I’d say Roger would have the advantage but only due to his crew’s strength. The Whitebeard pirates were not very strong when Oden joined, except WB himself of course. I think Oden was most likely the strongest in the WB pirates after WB himself.","You have to be clear. Are you talking specifically about the individual Kaido, or collectively with his crew? As an individual we don’t have anything to vouch for either premises (weakest or strongest), although, we do have his title “The Strongest Creature”, and we also have in Ace’s side novel (I don’t know what to call it) where they mentioned the difference between The Strongest Man (WB) and the Strongest Creature. As for Roger avoiding Big Mom, it doesn’t mean he feared her, it just means he didn’t want to engage in such a huge battle when he could simply avoid it. Of course, at that time, Kaido was still a young lad so he was nowhere close to Big Mom. 
As for the crew, the Big Mom’s does seem to have a much more established empire, I’d say she has the best Yonko empire but not necessarily the strongest one. We know Shanks has the highest “average” bounty of crewmates.",The weakest? and who decided that?,"I think it depends on the country. For Oman, from time to time the curfew can do more good than harm.",So Blue is sea/salty water and the other is clean/river water?,"The most stupid question, but which is which?",Lmao why,"Nice. That feeling you described is exactly what is sensed in the anime, and it’s the main reason it’s an exciting show/story. Is it a consistent weekly manga?","I have watched the anime last year, I think the second season is coming this winter. If you've watched the anime, how does the manga compare with the anime?","As many have explained, ""How are you?"" is a phatic expression that is used to acknowledge the social presence of both parties at scene. Thus, it is *not* useless, as it has a social use. Now, why does that use *exist?* How is that use ""helpful"" in any way even though the reply to it is usually ""I'm fine"" regardless of their actual state? Let me dissect into the perspectives of both the asker (A) and asked (B).

A asks how are you, now B can reply with:  
1- ""im fine what about you"" with a physical expression that is true to the reply.  
2- ""ehh, I'm fine"" obviously not fine, but the situation does not qualify for an elaboration.  
3- actually proceeds to describe why he's fine/not fine.

Take situation 3. B has opened the doors for a longer conversation with the potential of creating/strengthening a connection. A can extend the conversation or he could express a consolation for B and end it.

In situation 2, it is up to A to throw a reaching rope if he'd like, therefore further extending the conversation leading it to a similar situation of situation 3. Or, he could say "" sorry if you're having a bad day"" or just simply do nothing.

With situation 3,  A can either reply  with ""I'm fine too"", thus ending the conversation. Or, he could, again,  continue the chat therefore leading to situation 2 and possibly situation 3. 

So you see, all of these cases would've been nigh impossible or at least much more difficult to occur had it not been for a simple ""How are you"".",Well that does hook me. It is brutal with a unique girl and a lot of devils. Thanks dude,"I will check it out!  I have heard some talk about it here or there, what manga would you liken it to?","So I'm hungry for a lengthy, really good, and addictive manga to read. What with the COVID-19 and everything, there is much more time to read even though I read books and some on-going manga and I watch some anime too. I'd love some suggestions based on my reads or just generally great ones. Here is my list of my on-going manga: 

1- One Piece   -Obviously  
2- Kingdom    -Goodness of HoH  
3- One Punch Man   - Really funny and exciting, and Murata with the GODLY drawings  
4- Vinland Saga   - Monthly

Also: I finished Liars Game a couple of weeks ago. Finished mangas are also welcome obviously. I do lean more towards seinen/more mature shonen. But if it's really great  I don't care what type it is.",Just a little bit late.,"Example: 

Person D is within Group D of three people who are on a boat and are cruising on sea. Person X had a wrench and have accidently smashed a part of the boat. The ship have sunk and the waves were violent. All of Group D are now washed off at a shore by an uninhabited island.   
Now, only Person D's cellular phone work. Both Person D and the other member (Person Y) blame the state they are in entirely on Person X (and rightfully, I argue). Person X may or may not accept the blame, it is irrelevant. Person Y yields to the situation, and accepts that since he cannot control Person X ( who realistically cannot fix the situation), he cannot fix the problem. Person D realizes that even though his problem is solely caused by Person X, he himself has the only way of getting out of there. Therefore, he proceeds to use his phone to help himself from a problem he never caused. 

Conclusion: There is a difference between a cause and a solution. The thought process you mention is of those extremists (or kids) who believe (and act so) that the cause of the problem must fix the problem itself. The solution can come, or be done, from /by other entities that have nothing to do with the cause. The incentive being they  want to fix the problem they're in because it is affecting them regardless of the source of its source. Them acting on fixing it does not mean that they admit they are part of the problem or its cause, it means they admit they are affected by the problem and that they value fixing it over everything else.",Holy shit I didn’t get any of that.

I’ve been a STAH mom to a 13 month old for almost a year and am fully aware of how fortunate I am to be able to do it. However, I have absolutely no support, specifically from my husband. My husband works 7 days a week. M-F 12 hour shifts then Sunday and Saturday 8 hour shifts. He also works swing shift meaning every week his shift switches from first to third. I always look forward to when his shift changes because legally he has to be off for 24 hours meaning we can spend some time together as a family and then maybe I can get a little bit of help with our LO.

I always end up disappointed or resentful when he’s actually home. He never offers any help with anything, specifically our daughter. I have to ask him to change her diaper or to feed her and every single time I do I get this look of “are you seriously asking me this” or some snide remark. Never “of course I would love to help ____”. Never any initiative. I’m continuously reminding myself he works 76 hours a week and needs a break so I give him a pass. Most days during the week he doesn’t even see our daughter. 

Since it’s Saturday I figured after he wakes up we could all go out and do something. So I’m getting lunch ready for LO and he’s just standing in the kitchen drinking his coffee while I’m with LO while she’s eating and at the same time trying to put makeup on. He said he wanted to go outside to smoke and I asked him to sit with LO so I can put myself together instead. Nope, he wasn’t receptive to that. Just continued standing there while I’m still trying to put on makeup at our dining room table in between getting up to feed LO. He’s just watching me meanwhile there are dishes he could put in the dishwasher or just fucking ANYTHING rather than just standing there looking at us. This is getting so fucking exhausting. When LO was done eating I suggested him taking her to the playground and I’ll just stay home. I don’t really want to be around him. He’s mad at me, didn’t even say bye, and now I’m home alone with half my makeup done and nowhere to go. Situations like this happen constantly. Being a SAHM is harder than I would have ever imagined, especially having zero help with a child on top of the regular daily chores. I try really hard to be sympathetic to him because of how much he works, but where’s my sympathy? 

We’ve had many talks, they get us nowhere. I suggested counseling which he was surprisingly open to, however he literally has no time where we could squeeze that in. I don’t know what to do, I’m at a total loss. I’m so isolated in this house. My parents and in-laws lives many states away and the only family I have here is my sister, who is busy with her own life. I don’t really have friends. I started smoking cigarettes again after quitting for two years and have been drinking more (not getting drunk but will have 1-2 drinks after LO goes to bed). I want to get counseling for myself but what would I do with LO during my appointment? I feel hopeless and so alone. I feel like I’m a single mom. I need a break.


We sleep on separate floors in the house. We don’t have any alone time. Can’t remember the last time we went on a date. Don’t even watch movies or TV together since all he wants to do is play Call of Duty. When he hugs me or wants to kiss me it doesn’t feel good and I just wish he wouldn’t. I don’t want him touching me. I feel like I’m falling apart as well as my marriage.

Unless you want to role play and dont care about end game or having your base stand for more than a day or 2 then go ahead but lets be realistic,Not sure about tuesdays but stevious has a monday server which is pretty popping usually,As someone with almost 4k hours i can honestly say unless you are dedicated and have 12+ hours a day then no dont play solo,Will defo be doing that cause i cant accept that that is “normal” any idea what it could be or what may change with the re test,Close to a year im not at home atm so i cant check hes records,"All i can remember of the top of my head is he was tested for cat flu feline hiv, and cancer they also dyed hes eye and inspected it",Hello i have a slightly overweight male cat (neutered) roughly 9 years old(adopted) and he has a problem with hes right eye https://imgur.com/a/fiMVWIi he doesn’t seem to be in much pain and it doesn’t weep alot we have taken him too our vet who has run every test and cannot find a cause and basically just told us its normal and he might be that way forever gave him eye drops for when it flairs up and sent us on our way what should i do?,There is a quick loot option hold h and drag your mouse over the items :D,Rastangelo :),There are alot of players out there better than anyone on your list you should have said 5 best streamers,Uninstall eac verify game in steam,Validate your game in steam maybe?,Spaz Mp5 m9 L9?

enlightenmereddit,"Hi Doodler, I sympathize with you. I am currently completing outpatient psychiatric treatment for depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. I told my psychiatrist that I was suicidal - no one took me away and locked me in a psychiatric ward. I was extremely suicidal. He asked me if I owned a gun, which I don’t and I told him that. Idk if that would have made a difference but it’s something to think about. It’s important to be honest with your psychologist and psychiatrist so that the treatment can suit you - the treatment is a process and unfortunately can take a few months to get right. Many of these people (psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists) will sympathize with you - they have dedicated their lives to helping individuals like you who are suffering.",you have a similar look to Rachel Weisz who is referred to as an English Rose :) Your hair is an amazing feature you have!,not just not ugly but you are gorgeous! your eyebrows are goals!,"a fiercely stylish, cute couple!",yw! that sounds similar to the Golden Ratio Eyebrow Shaping Method developed by ABH creator!

Crazybritzombie,"I'm not doing well tonight. The last few months have felt like I've been falling deeper and deeper into this hole. My husband has major depression so he doesn't think I'm that bad and thus I can't talk to him or else he starts talking about how he's worthless and thus instead of talking about my issues I have to hold his hand. I can't talk to my mom because she just starts in on how terrible her life is and how ungrateful I am. I have hardly any energy and everything hurts lately. I'm gaining weight and it takes a lot for me to want to wake up. I have no friends and whenever i try to schedule stuff i either get stood up or my husband and mom will tell me that I'll hate it and it is just a waste. I make $9.00 an hour working full time at a temp job that keeps telling me ""just a couple more weeks"" before they'll hire me permanently. I have type 1 diabetes and have been rationing my insulin out for the past 3 months. My doctor won't give me any more samples unless I see him which is $300 I don't have. Because I work full time I don't qualify for a lot of the programs around here. My husband has promised for years that he'll get a good job amd I won't have to worry anymore but I feel like he's just pulling a long con. I asked him to find a part time job while he's going to school monday thru wednesday and he blew up at me. I'm just at this point of giving up. Nothing I ever do will amount to anything. I'm fucking 32 years old still living with my mom. I've stopped caring about what will happen to the cats and dogs if I die because they don't care about me anyways. I feel so utterly alone and so tired of fighting for such a shitty life. I don't even know why I'm posting, I guess just to vent because I literally have no one else to talk to. ","Oh no! I think it is the wrong guy definitely. This is the link to the correct guy:

Thanks for the info!,"Hi all,
    I'm looking for either a company or landlord that would rent to someone that owns 3 40lb dogs. Any information would be greatly appreciated. ","I originally posted this to fb to rant but I only keep a small amount of friends and I thought I would entertain you guys with how my night has gone. Also, my dogs'  names are Tammy, Toki, and Daisy (who played the part of a neutral country tonight). We don't/wont have kids so I dont know how/if the dogs should be abbreviated. Onto the story...

I was having such a good night until I got home. I walk in, can't even put my leftovers in the fridge before my mom pipes up and says that the dogs got into a ""scuffle"" right after we left at 415 (it was 8pm at that point) and she couldn't get them separated. She even threw a pillow at them you guys. She says she ""checked over "" each dog to make sure they weren't hurt. I believed her at this point in time. 

 I proceed to sit down on the couch and Tammy immediately comes over to me.  I don't even put my hand fully on her head for ear scratches before she yelps. I look at her and she has a good amount of blood on both sides of her ear, scrapes on either side of her face and blood on  her neck from her ear. But my mom totally checked her out you guys. 

I try to clean the wounds on her ear but the blood has clotted on her fur and she's trembling something awful. I start looking at websites on how to proceed on whether we should take her to the emergency vet or if there are any tips on cleaning out minor puncture wounds.  Tammy decides she's had enough and goes over to the back door. While looking at her from far away I notice her face is pretty swollen, probably from the bite marks on her cheek. She looks absolutely miserable. 

My phone is at like 3% so I go back to the room to charge it while internally debating on whether to go to the emergency vet or not. We finally made the decision to wait but to go to walmart and get some unexpired antibiotic ointment and betadine. My mom tried to hand me some sort of antibiotic that was for our cat's vagina that expired in 2014. I don't remember what my mom said to ignite me but I just know that I was seeing red.  I asked her why she didn't tell us immediately and she said she didn't want to ""ruin"" my night (wtf). I asked why she didn't spend 5 seconds telling my DH since he had dropped me off to dinner and he was only gone about 30 min. She hemmed and hawed and couldn't come up with an answer (it was pathetic, almost like someone at a senate hearing). Then she started saying that she wasn't negligent, that I was attacking her and being mean  and I just lost it. Sure, you can say she wasn't negligent since she was physically  in the same room ""watching"" the dogs but she sure as hell was incompetent. She allowed our dog to sit in pain for almost 3 hours. She either told a bold faced lie about checking them out or she is so grossly lacking in basic eye sight that she couldn't see blood on Tammy's neck from the hole in her ear. I mean, COME ON!!! 

So, she continued to complain that I was attacking her (lol, no, I was holding her accountable for her screwups. If I was attacking her it would have been a lot more verbally violent and she would have known what the difference was). This is the most hilarious part. It was pouring out rain due to TS Gordon and she went out onto the back deck. She came in once, saw we were still sitting there and proceeded to go back out into the rain for another 10 minutes. Ill admit, when she turned back around that I purposely sat in the living room waiting to see how long she would allow herself to get drenched (we had 5 inches of rain in parts). After she finally came back inside, she went to go hide in her room like a sullen teenager, and we went to walmart. 

Now, Tammy has been given pain medication and her wounds cleaned to the best of our abilities. This is the worst Tammy and Toki have gotten into it which tells us my mom wasn't paying attention to them at all. Tammy will snap at Toki if he gets in her bubble but thats about it. if Tammy starts something more serious though, Toki will make sure to finish it. It is normally just a bunch of posturing though and no one ever gets hurt. That indicates even more that my mom was completely ignoring them because even if you say their names they'll go about their business. I'm annoyed that the dogs fought, but I'm not blaming my mom for that. i am, however, blaming her for being completely incomprehensibly incompetent and because of that incompetence my dog sat in pain with dirty wounds for 3 hours longer than needed.

",The humane society charges money to drop off a pet I believe. ,Im afraid of adjusting anything like the ratio because I just got the tension right with wool.

This peke is a poor thing but not all pekes are like that. If you look at white pekes (which of course aren't the breed standard), they tend to have better health. The problem here isn't the breed, but the standards that the dog shows set. Pekes are such a force of personality in a little 15lb package it is insane. I just lost my 15 year old in July and I miss her insanely. 

On that note, there are several amazing rescues in the US that work with pekes. One of those is Liz E's Peke Sanctuary in Arkansas. They have a lot of dogs that have their own day of the week (Check out Walter Wednesday!) And they do everything they can to help out with these furry kings and queens. I'm not affiliated with them, I just want to have a pack of pekes like them. 

Here's their facebook if you want to see them all:

isabellk2010,"Two years ago I left a highly toxic, abusive relationship. I guess that's where it started, when my parents told me to get out of their house and I had to go live with my narcissistic boyfriend. I stayed there for 6 years, got through University, had my own house. 

And then it got to a point where I felt like I was dying. Nothing brought me happiness and all I felt was blank, static-y, fear and numbness. I got PTSD from those 6 years. I finally called my parents on Dec 30, 2018 after a bad fight with my ex. And I left and didn't speak to him again. 

During 2019, I was working and saving money to move out on my own again, living with my parents. My ex took all of the money we had and I was left with none. I spent that year trying to heal, to get better and get some joy back into my life. I'm not sure if it worked. 

And early 2020 I had planned to move out. But I lost my job because of COVID. I still had debts and bills to pay, so my money went back to scraping by. I still haven't found a job even with my education and experience. So moving out and getting back onto my own two feet doesn't look like it's happening. 

My parents don't help the matter. They're passive-agressive, childish in their interactions. When they're upset, they take it out on everyone else. It makes me feel terrible because I keep going back to my pattern of ""what did I do wrong? How do I fix it?"" And meltdown. The things they do are too reminiscent of the toxic ex and it scares me, makes me feel panicked. I spend a lot of time with this sick, heavy weight in my gut.

Today, I was told that because I'm 27 I should be acting more my age, not so ""sad"" and ""lazy"". They aren't running ""a fucking hotel here for you"". My father told me to fuck off. My mother doesn't stop him. I've tried to be a part of this home; cook, keep it neat, be respectful, try to find a job. 

I've tried to tell them I'm depressed. I tried to tell them all the reasons why I feel like this. I tried to tell them some days I just want to stare at a blank wall for hours. I tried to tell them I'm not choosing to feel like this, not choosing to be depressed. 

I don't think they understand. I'm stuck in a house with them because I have nowhere else to go. 

I feel like I'm drowning. Like there's all this dark water around me swallowing me and no matter what I do, I won't ever get out. I've tried. I've applied to at least 70 jobs in the past 3 months. I counted. I even went and got more schooling during lockdown. I've tried to save money, but when my ex left me with $20,000+ of debt, it's difficult to. I've tried to be happy around them, tried to be good with them. 

But it isn't enough. Nothing I do is enough. All I want is my own work or career, my own home, some freedom. Freedom to live my life, to be calm and happy in my own space with my own money. My own purpose and life. 

But no matter what I do, I can't make it work. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know what options I have. I guess I'll just go sit outside for a couple hours like I always do when my parents go on their passive-aggressive, childish, nasty tangent. It's the only thing I can do. When I tried to argue back, say my piece, they shut all of it down and told me to fuck off. So, I guess this is where I stand.","My grandparents' SUV, a 2006 Ford Freestyle SEL 3.0L V6, is having some kind of issue. 

While driving, at any speed, the car will just completely turn off as if the driver turned the key off. Engine shuts off, all electronics turn off, and it locks completely up (steering and brakes). Once it does this, you can't even switch into neutral, but you can turn the key though it will not turn over (no clicking noises either). Either the car will turn back on after a few minutes with the key turn, or they'll need to take the positive battery cable off for a few minutes. Once the positive cable is back on, the car will usually start up again. 

But then it will do it all over again - shutting off while moving and not wanting to start. 

I initially thought it might be a burnt out fuse, but they all seem fine and any changes I've made hasn't made a difference in the car's problems. I am considering that it's the ignition switch that has gone bad, but it could also maybe be a bad crankshaft sensor? 

The battery is good, the alternator is good, and there is a full tank of gas. The car doesn't stutter or struggle, or even slowly lose power. It just completely turns off as it would when you turn the key. 

Interestingly enough, the first time it happened, there was a loud static sound through the speakers before it died. Not sure what that means. 

Does anyone know what this could be? Has anyone ever dealt with this before? Thank you in advance.","You're right! I have heard the sentiments of the LDPR. And perhaps in this world I'm writing, their plans worked. So how do I name it in a way that makes sense, you know? The Slavic Empire of Tsar Nikolai?

You've been a help, thanks for your input.","Geopolitics is a pain in the ass occasionally, I studied it in university. So I understand that there are multiple things I need to take into account when worldbuilding. 

Which is why I'm here. I wanted some other inputs and ideas to give me a good base as to what direction I should go. Do I leave things as they are? Or do I build a new nation that came about? 

And maybe, no, nations don't just up and rename themselves, but it isn't unheard of. Russia was a part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and perhaps they created another union similar to that. But what would I call it that makes sense? 

That's my line of thinking, anyway.",That's what I was thinking! I like the idea of different nations joining up together. Thank you!,">the infamous trend to just lump together a Middle-Eastern Coalition comes to mind (bonus points if it includes Israel).

Reading that I got shivers down my spine. 

I studied International Affairs in university and I totally understand what you're saying in your post. I'm not going to rename them for something 'hip and cool to write', there are reasons for it. I'm wanting to immerse the reader in this future where things are different, where the tensions of today have caused nations to evolve into something different. 
For example, Russia's aggression in the east of Europe - let's assume that they did manage to annex Ukraine and Belarus years later, but didn't want to call them republics anymore. Russia wanted an entire nation back under a tsar and tsarina due to the 'coming together' of these eastern nations. 

Those are the types of things I'm working with, and that's why I was thinking to rename them. 

And as for all the world building I'm to do, I'm actually quite enjoying it. That may change, but I'm happy with it thus far. I, myself, have always liked novels that have a lot of world building and take time to explain history and environment.",">Also... keep in mind that the future might be an offensive place. What's realistic isn't always what's nice.

I'm aware, and I'm fine with stretching things a little. I just didn't want something overtly and obviously wrong. 
Kind of like how someone gets a Kanji tattooed on them thinking it says 'strength' and it actually reads as 'microwave' or something similar. Just getting some other ideas and research in before deciding what to go with. 

Thank you!","All excellent ideas! I like the idea of having acronyms or shorthand versions. That helps, thank you.

Also, you really did capture the reason why I wanted to rename them - in 165 years from now, things are going to be vastly different, with our rate of change when it comes to technology, and it would make sense that nations would change.",">I personally do this to distance the future from the present

This is exactly why I'd like to. To hint at the reader that things are different, these places still exist, but they aren't the way they know them right now. 

And yes, I do plan to give details as to why they've been renamed and what the changes have been.

I'm looking to rename China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The only problem is, I'm not sure what to name them that would make sense and be appropriate to those nations. 
I've read a few books where the countries have been renamed, but they came off insensitive and didn't seem to fit. 
I've been searching online, but haven't found much help. If there is anyone who might have ideas on what would be a good renaming, I'd appreciate it. 

Edit: I'm worldbuilding. I want Earth based governments and nations to remain, but that have changed due to politics, economics, wars, technology, etc. I thought I should make that clearer, that I'm not renaming for the sake of renaming.

zoonthego,Only Harry Potter readers will get this. ,Tough croud. ,"""No matter how I put them in"" is inclusive of that. ","Thank you for your well written comment. You have certainly changed my view slightly. 

Though, to really ensure myself, I must ask: do you also defend peaceful protests by BLM? I am aware that there is sometimes violence, but there has been peaceful protests. You state you hate Nazism but threatening their 1st amendment rights threatens everyones. Im aware you hate BLM and sometimes the protest get violent, but when it comes to peaceful ones do you support their 1st amendment rights and condemn people that say they don't have the right to protest? If people say peaceful BLM protesters shouldn't have a platform does that scare you too?

What bothers me a lot about conservative stances is the hypocrisy. Please tell me I'm wrong. ","I live in a quite progressive place so my exposure to conservatives is small. My opinion is based off of conservative rhetoric online mostly. Including right wing subreddits, FB pages, and comments on news articles. 

I never said the NFL couldn't drop him if they want. I was using him as an example of hypocrisy. The right quickly defends the person sporting a Swastika' s free speech rights, but doesn't apply the same support to someone they disagree with. I feel like this shows there is more to this. It seems emotional. ","I agree with your first paragraph.

With the Kaepernick thing, you can compare them and I did. I feel like you cant claim it's the first amendment you're defending rather than the protesters themselves, when you don't apply that same passion to someone else peacefully protesting something you disagree with. I think there is more to it. A lot of people are saying it's also to spite the left, which I agree. ","I dont think the Westboro Baptist Church is on the conventional political spectrum and no one claims the right supports them so I feel that's a moot point.

I'm not saying the right are Nazis. I dont think that. Of course not. I simply feel like they emotionally appeal to their sentiment. I feel this is most apparent in my example to how the right reacted to Kaepernick and Charlottesville.  ","Im glad to hear that you personally don't empathize with them. If you pay attention to my word use you'd know I am aware not everyone is like that. I use ""generally"" and say at the end I know this isn't everyone. The way I see it, conservatives seem to generally feel this way in the same aspect that conservatives generally oppose abortion. ","Of late there has been a lot of tension surrounding extreme right-wing groups. I've noticed the consensus from the right seems to lean more to defending them than disavowing the content of their platform. I understand, and believe for the most part both sides agree, that the Constitution says they have the right to peacefully assemble and protest without government persecution--this is a lawful fact. I'm not arguing against that. What I'm claiming is, generally, individuals on the right actually empathize with actual neo-nazis, white supremacists and white nationalists. There is much evidence of this.

First off, it seems that the right cannot criticize these hate groups without comparing them to the left. I've seen a post and like posts in my FB feed, not critisizing the right in anyway, but saying things a long the lines of: ""Nazis are bad. Period"". And ""if you carry this flag [swastika flag] you're not a patriot"". These posts are not saying anything against free speech; just disavowing an objectively evil symbol, and generally the right fails to just say: ""I agree, Nazism is evil"". It's either A. Defending their Constitutional right or B. Claiming BLM and the like are of the same caliber of evil as Nazis which in my opinions is an emotional fallacy. A guise to, maybe even unconsciously, express their bias toward these hate groups. 

Further evidence that supports my view is blatant hypocrisy when citing free speech. The right is very quick to defend someone literally carrying a Nazi flag's first amendment rights, but when, for example, Colin Kaepernick sat out the national anthem they did not spout the same rhetoric. Generally, they did not say ""I dont agree with Kaepernick but I respect his first ammenment rights"". They are very quick to say this about someone *literally sporting a swaztika* but not Kaepernick, which proves this is more than merely being passionate about the 1st amendment. They wanted his head and him banned from the NFL (which is more hyprocrasy because the right complained about the firing of the Google employee). 

I'm not saying every right wing individual is this way. Rather, based on the rights rhetoric thus far, it generally seems this way. One more example is John McCain posting on his Facebook that Neo-Nazism and white supremacy is evil and has no place in America's values. He did not say anything against free speech. Just that this was evil. Low and behold he was met with criticism by his fellow Republicans for this post. 

I'm posting this here because I dont want to believe the party that controls the majority of our government emotionally appeals to these people. I want to love my country. So for the love of God, CMV. ",It really is. It's scary to think who is under these sheets--your professor? Local police officer?

I don't have an opinion on the content of the memo, but I can tell you that boycotting Google won't change anything. They made the decision because either way someone will be angry--if they kept the guy the other side would be enraged, and they would lose a bigger customer base. They chose the option that benefited them the most and satisfied their consumers. It's important to know that he was not fired for exercising his opinion guaranteed through the first amendment--but rather it going viral with Google's name attached to it.

We live in a toxic culture where a corporation has one viral mishap and they're the devil. Take United Airlines for example--people forgot about that in two weeks and I'm sure plenty of people who claimed to never fly them again will in a jiffy if they offer the cheapest flight (I don't agree how they handled that situation btw).

The couple that owns the lease are very nice to me and encourage me to express my identity. One roomate is actually a friend of mine since high school who's pretty chill and the step brother of the girl who is on the lease. The other roommate though was an absolute ass to me today. He brought a friend over to the house that was rude as fuck about me wearing a dress. Then the roommate goes on to say I shouldn't be wearing dresses in the house and that I have to wear pants. He then later said that I'm a guy wearing a dress and that I'm even bigger freak for still liking women. I brushed it off because I know other people have faced much worse than that. However the lady who owns the lease decided to bring her mom and stepdad over for a family meeting. They blasted the roommate for treating me like that and threatened to evict him if he continued.

However last night his sister came to talk to me while he was at work, and she showed how much stress she was in over the money. I felt so bad I gave his sister the card and told her everything.

That's all I would hear from him, I tried asking what was going on but I couldn't get an answer. Since then he wont talk to me  and avoids me as much as possible. I don't know what I did to make him mad but it feels quite obvious I did something.

I’ve talked to my parents a little about it but I’m scared to open up to them because of what they might say.

When I told my mom I wanted to go she said it was fine but was a bit hesitant because she didn’t know the other girl. My dad in the other hand did not want me to go. I couldn’t really tell why but usually he wasn’t like this so I have to assume it was the same reason my mom was skeptical. I told them both that they aren’t always going to know who I’m hanging out with and that they have to come to terms with that. Anyway they let me go and we are having a good time, that is until we went trick or treating. My long time friends little cousin was at her house so we took her around the neighborhood to entertain her. But every now and then I kept seeing multiple Fords drive past. I was confused because they looked the same until I realized it was my dad. When I tried to get him to stop he wouldn’t and when I got home denied everything. I don’t know what he thought was going to happen. This is the worst of it, however I have begun to notice that they are seemingly always in the room.

sketchartist00,"So I’m 19 and suffering from some severe depression because nearly 2 months ago my best friend was murdered by a drunk driver. For the first month after his death I was deeply in the denial stage but now I find myself falling deeper and deeper into the depression stage. So much so that I’ve resorted to alcohol and weed to numb myself for even just a few hours because the depression has started causing me to physically ache from how bad it’s got. I’m a medical Mary patient and have been a stoner for about 2.5 years now. Before I was using weed in a productive way to help ease the stress and pain of ptsd, gerd and insomnia but ever since he died I’ve found myself using it the wrong way. When I have my hands on a few grams I’ll smoke all day and do nothing but sleep and eat but this week I’ve taken a turn for the worst and resorted back to what 16 year old me did when she was feeling like this and I’ve been binge drinking my parents alcohol. I’m actually currently in a cold sweat and shaking from being hungover as I write this. Lately I’ve been considering signing up for my local psych hospitals outpatient program to maybe help me find people who are going through something similar and to get some professional help. (Note I do have à therapist and psychiatrist but my therapist is currently pregnant and often has to cancel sessions due to severe morning sickness) I’ve talked to my parents who while are not openly telling me not to go but keep telling me “op you already have medical bills and you don’t need more” I’ve also talked to a few of my friends who have openly told me that they don’t think I should go and yes for the most part they’re aware of my deteriorating mental health and substance abuse. A big part of me desperately wants to go back and get this situation sorted out before I get any worse but another big part of me is scared that if I go to the hospital that they’ll put me in inpatient which is where my ptsd originally stems from. I just want to get back to my old happy self I was before my best friend was so selfishly taken from me, any advice? And please no hate.

This whole situation was so stressful that just writing it caused an anxiety attack 😂,"I want to start off by saying that I don't hate my aunt, I love her a lot I'm just at my breaking point with her general entitlement. I have two stories to share today about the entitlement I've experienced from her first hand. this post isn't meant to bash her or hate on her in any way. this is just my way to vent my frustrations about her general attitude lately.

this first incident happened on my mom's birthday during my mom's birthday dinner in March 2019. we had gone out to our favorite hibachi and sushi restaurant. as always I sat next to my aunt because before that day my aunt was my favorite person. everything was fine until my aunt being her normal overly pc self decided to snap at me for the way I had said a joke to my mom because I was apparently being racist. all I had done was make a joke in a deep manly voice coincidentally at the same moment a black family had been seated at the table next to us and me using that tone of voice was apparently racist towards that black family in her eyes. this is when I decided to go silent and just sit on my phone. at some point a few minutes later my aunt and I began arguing because I was ignoring her and she said ""skethartist00 you'll never survive on your own!"" then she went on to say, ""you'll never make as much money in your life as I make in a year"" this not only pissed me off but also my mother. I being the pissed off 17-year old I was at the time said ""if you're going to be like this then do me a favor and DONT come to my birthday dinner next month"" this pissed her off again but by the time I had said that we were getting ready to leave and I wasn't planning on staying long enough to hear her response.

the next incident which happened to be the nail in the coffin on why I've cut her out, for the time being, happened on thanksgiving of last year (2019) id like to just say that my memory of this whole situation is a bit blurred because I was very stoned during the main conflict which ill mention exactly when I became stoned.(we live in California where it's legal) 

this all began after dinner and while we were cleaning up. in my family when we clean up thanksgiving dinner is when everyone gets their doggy bags ready to go. now, days before this my mom had gotten new Tubber wear which was not cheap. we had saved a few extra containers from our old set so that my family could use those and we wouldn't have to worry about getting them back.

as we were cleaning up my aunt goes to grab some plastic containers like she normally does but the one she grabs are the new ones. my mom politely tells my aunt to use one of the older containers. my aunt doesn't like this and argues that my mom shouldn't worry because she'll get them back the next time we see my aunt, which wouldn't be for a while since we've decided to spend Christmas at home this year. my mom counters that she uses those containers to take her lunch to and from work so my aunt needs to use the older containers. my aunt again begins complaining that she wants to use the newer and nicer containers and again my mom says no because they were expensive  (we spent around 100 dollars on them) and that again she needs them for lunch. 

the argument escalates to the point where they're both full-on screaming at each other while my older brother and I just sit there at the island and give each other the ""this is gonna be bad"" look. my aunt doing what she does best and plays the victim card when my grandparents ask what's wrong and of course as always they take my aunt's side and basically gang up on my mom. at this point, my grandparents, dad, and uncle all wander into the kitchen and the screaming match continues. now normally I'd be all into this and trying to stop the argument but lately, I had been avoiding conflict so I just sat there and listened to the screaming. at one point my brother steps out onto the back deck. he waits a moment before giving me the signal (we have a signal to ask each other to go smoke without making it obvious) to which I obviously agree to because I'm fed up with all the screaming. he goes around the back of the house to the garage and I meet him there by going through the house. my dad soon follows and we all pack a bowl and smoke to calm down.

a few minutes later my mom comes to the garage and flips us all off. (for not being there for her) the 3 of us just look at each other thinking wtf because we didn't do anything. I then have to go to the bathroom so I sneak in and while I'm using the bathroom I can still hear the 3 of them screaming. at this point, my grandma and aunt have fully ganged up on my mom and are now making her feel bad for wanting to spend Christmas at the house and not with them. my mom goes on to say that she has another side of the family (my dad's side) who she never gets to see because my aunt constantly uses the excuse of ""well we don't have very many \*enter random holiday\* left with mom and dad"" which can I just say is so extremely manipulative. 

I go back out to my dad and brother who immediately ask me what's going on. I tell them what I heard and my dad decides that enough is enough and that we need to go, support mom since no one was defending her in this. we all go back in and take our original seats. now at this point, I'm very stoned so this is where certain things become a bit blurred. as we sat down the argument continues and it's very obvious that they're against my mother because my mom is alone over by the oven while everyone else is at the bar on the opposite end of the kitchen screaming at her. 

at this point, I'm fed up. I was just trying to enjoy a nice drama-free Thanksgiving with my family for once and the first year where I'm not the one starting drama (thank you weed) world war 3 breaks out in my kitchen. I decide to butt in because I just couldn't handle the arguing. I basically tell everyone to shut the hell up and that this argument is childish. my aunt and grandmother basically tell me to mind my own business but I'm not done. I tell them that they're ganging up on my mom and that I'm not going to stand by any longer and just watch it happen. my grandma then says ""\*my real name\* shes your mother obviously you're going to take her side"" this kinda pisses me off because at this time my relationship with my mother was still a bit rocky. not to mention the fact that every person in that room (brother, grandparents, parents, aunt, and uncle) has each had a huge part in raising me (yes including my brother. he was 12 when I was born) so the fact that she thinks I'm only defending my mother because my mother was the one who gave birth to me pisses me off. I'm the kind of person who in these sorts of situations I'll take the side of whoever I feel needs the most support at the moment and that person just happened to be my mother. 

the argument continues, now with my mom and aunt yelling at each other and my grandmother yelling at me while I try and calmly tell her what I said above about who I defend. during this, I get super overwhelmed from all the screaming and from my body basically fighting against the high which is fighting to keep me calm and I burst into tears. the moment this happens... silence. for the first time in about an hour or two, everyone stops yelling and they immediately try and make me feel better. I kinda push them all off me because I not only get super embarrassed when I cry (yes even in. front of family) but this sudden burst of tears caused a minor anxiety attack to take over. I basically storm upstairs thinking that I had just ended the situation and try and cool down. the fighting continues for another half an hour before my aunt, uncle, and grandparents all storm out and goes home. 

I know these stories aren't the most entitled thing ever but it was enough to make me want to remove my aunt from my life for the time being.","so today honestly wasn't my day. Not the worst day ever but still super irritating. as always I woke up at 10 am, took my dog out and got ready for the day. I went to therapy then ran some errands which were fine minus the 60 mph winds which made the drive a bit more difficult. my day honestly seemed like it was going great until about thirty minutes before I was supposed to meet my mom at the grocery store when a bunch of bratty high schoolers decided to start harassing my dog from the park behind my house. they were running back and forth, throwing sticks, and actively trying to piss my dog off. not to mention they were banging rocks against the metal bars on the playground and screaming at the top of their lungs. overall they were just being little dicks. I finally had enough so I got in my car and drove to the park (I wasn't going to walk because it was cold and like I said 60 mph winds) I got there and immediately told them that they can either stop being loud and harassing my dog or I would call the cops. they got defensive and tried to act like they had done nothing wrong to which I said that if I ever saw them messing with my dog again that I'd call the cops because I'm not going to deal with a bunch of rowdy boys messing with my dog and making her bark while I was trying to get work done (this is normally when I work on commissions but I took a day off to run errands and go to therapy) they then walked off while flipping me off. I just drove home. 

about an hour later I go to meet my mom at the store and everything was fine until we get out to our cars (we parked right next to each other) where we find 2 shopping carts, one slammed into the front of my moms BMW and the other shoved in between our cars. thankfully nothing happened to our cars but it really ticked me off because the little cart station thing... WAS DIRECTLY NEXT TO MY MOMS CAR. these carts weren't even 6 feet from the cart return and the fact that someone shoved the one cart in between our cars was a serious dick move. like dude have some respect  and just put your fucking cart in the cart return it wouldn't have killed you. 

now your probably wondering why I'm upset enough to post about this day on here, well it gets worse.

my mom gave me her card to go get pizza from this local place that I've been a regular at for the last 11 years because I've been craving real pizza for 2 weeks now. before I go on I should mention that I have severe social anxiety and when talking to new people I stutter, trip over my words and speak fast. I go in and go up to the register to check-in and pay. like always I begin to trip over my words and before I could even finish one of the cashiers says ""can you hurry up. I don't have all day"" in the snarkiest attitude ever. this absolutely pisses me off but I decide not to say anything because I didn't want to cause a scene. while I'm waiting for my order the cashier is again very rude to multiple other customers. I'm honestly so pissed off because this girl is the reason I stopped going to this restaurant. every single time I go in to order she always has a bad attitude. and is always so rude. that girl is the reason that the restaurant lost a VERY loyal customer. I used to order from there at a minimum twice a month for the last 11 years! I've gone on dates there, I used to walk there after school with friends every Friday for a quick bite before football games, my family and I have had countless birthdays there, and some of my favorite memories are at that restaurant. now all. because of one. awful, rude ass employee my family and I refuse to go. 

overall my day was not the best but hey at least I finally got some real pizza.",Honestly I’m pale af and i love it. I’d rather be pale than golden brown. I spent years trying to achieve the perfect tan and it wasn’t worth it. All I did was damage my already beautiful skin and I could have harmed myself a lot more. Being pale is awesome and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!,"Agreed. I understand having the expectation that your significant other should treat you like a queen or a king because you should have that expectation. But calling yourself one makes you seem like an egotistical bitch who doesn’t care about anyone but yourself. It’s not cute, it’s not funny, it’s not attractive. What it is, is relationship repellant",Oh trust me karma will get them. The first girl to ever bully me (before middle school and not the same one from middle school) became the most hated girl in my grade by the time we graduated high school. It made me feel bad but at the same time she kinda deserved it,I’m so sorry. I’m always here if you ever need anything. I know what it’s like.,They are. That was almost 5 years ago. I’m now a high school graduate and I’m pretty happy with life now,I was severely bullied in middle school to the point of my depression getting so bad that I had to be hospitalized and where I developed an addiction to self harm. My school was BEYOND aware of the situation and instead of handling the situation the right way they constantly just sent me off to different mental hospitals. I missed nearly 80 days of school my 8th grade year because of this. My mom had to take nearly 2 months off of work unpaid because she mentally couldn’t handle the abuse I was enduring and because she was constantly on the phone with the school to try and get them to do anything about the situation. Not even the threat of multiple lawsuits were enough to convince my school to do anything. All because my main bullys parents have hella money and my school was scared of them. The American school system sucks fucking ass when it comes to bully prevention and it disgusts me,Agreed. I’m extremely open about being an atheist and I have family who are legitimate heads of church and they constantly make me feel bad for following what I truly believe deep down. It honestly just makes me want to be an atheist more by seeing how disgustingly they treat their own family simply for being who they truly are.

When you say ""put them on the map"", people are going to assume you mean that Red Velvet's success with the general public began with Red Flavor, which isn't true because looking at their past chartings, that's not a feat that can only be done just within the Kpop community, the general public has always known who Red Velvet is even if they're not fully invested in the group prior to RF. Red Flavour was the turning point of all RV's past successes, it's the culmination and establishment of RV's continual and growing success into the mega-hit that is RF. Comparing that to their past releases isn't a good measurement because it launched itself into a whole new league. You also failed to outline the guidelines for this map other than listing longevity as your requirement for how successful a track is which is narrow-minded as a successful release has more points to it than that. You seem dead set on this so it seems reasonable to end this conversation. ","RF didn't put RV ""on the map"", they were already gaining major attraction since debut. Track after track, they were gaining more and more attention plus positive reviews, both which was a combination of fans and the general public's interest. Yes, RF's success was a major booster for them but insinuating it put them on this so-called map (what are you even basing it on?) isn't true when RV as group and their music has been well received by the public since Happiness (hit #1 on genie, bugs, was #2 on daum, #7 on naver and #8 on melon). 

\>You're thinking of musically. Red Flavor was EVERYWHERE.

What does this even mean? What do you mean by musically? 

&#x200B;

\> It put them on the map because the GP kept listening to it. The GP will check out the song but they won't check out the group.

This makes zero sense to me, RV's continual success leading up to RF can brew gp's interest in them and which it obviously has. Also, that's a bit of a wild assumption because the GP can listen to RF but may not check out the group at all. It never put them on the map, it's a mega-hit amongst their other hits.   


It just sounds you're discrediting RV's past successes. ","My post keeps putting the same articles for the seoulbeat links so I'll put them here. TT

&#x200B;","Happy 4 years to Jjong's debut album Base! Four years ago in Korea, Jjong released his first ever mini, starting his wonderful journey as a solo artist!\~ Base is an incredibly sensual album from beginning to end and a wonderful gift for blingers and shawols alike!\~

&#x200B;

Base was entirely Jjong's work, Zion T., wefreaky, deez and sojin helped compose songs Deja-boo, Lovebelt, NEON, Beautiful Tonight and a special track called Fortune cookie which Jjong later released an MV for with Mnet. The title track for Base, 'Crazy' was released 4 days before the actual drop of the album along with his showcase, 'Base of Jonghyun'! There's a playlist of the base of Jonghyun performances (as I couldn't find an actual full video TT) that you can watch and here are some of the teasers for the promotion of Base along with the Crazy MV!\~

Here are some excerpts from the many interviews he did!

**Articles/Interviews!**

GQ 2015!

**Tomorrow is the last broadcast of your solo promotion. You probably won't have feelings for this kind of thing too, will you?**

>J: Yes. Because it all disappears in a sudden after having been so busy.

&#x200B;

**If you were to self-evaluate your solo promotion?**

>J: It was fun. There were those things that were even more fun with the expected ones trailing off...

&#x200B;

**\[Is this\]the title song?**

>J: Yes. Crazy was the main title song but 'Deja-boo' became the one I did more on broadcasts. A title song is 'a song that I can do well' to a performer. However a title song seems like 'a song that needs to hit' to a producer. The song that fits right at the point of contact with these two is 'Deja-boo.' If 'Deja-boo' is the trace of my music, won't Crazy be the trace of my constraint about something new...

The Celebrity - ""Between Talent and Justice, Jonghyun:

**You must have been looking forward to the new year more than anyone, with your solo album announcement coming up.**

>J: I waited with a fluttering heart, wishing it would come quickly: on the other hand, since my job entails getting evaluated for what I produce, I also felt fear and worry at the same time.

&#x200B;

**Is your solo album BASE filled up well with the type of music you wanted to let us hear and see?**

>J: Yes - more than just me in this moment, it contains an image of myself that I've built up little by little.

&#x200B;

**Rather than calling this album a new beginning, you're personally organising one chapter of your musical activities and showing it to us.**

>J: Exactly. The songs that are on this album could be different from the style of music that I enjoy listening to or composing these days. There's a song on there I wrote 4 years ago, and the most recent one is from a year ago. I'll be able to show you my most current work when another opportunity arises in the future, and I think the word ""base"" is more meaningful because I can show you what I've built up until this moment.

TW/// Dec. 18th

Whatever happens that day, let yourself grieve and even if you don't/can't, don't beat yourself up for it. The absence of grief doesn't take away your love for Jjong and it doesn't mean you aren't sad or affected by what happened.

EvanPennington96,"I have a very important question to everyone that has been depressed. I've become very aware of my reactions to emotions and been getting much more into mediation and improving my mental fortitude and happiness, but am still struggling with bouts of depression.

I have noticed that when I am feeling down or depressed, my actual perception of life is altered. Color's are less bright, objects don't look as sharp or clear, my peripheral vision awareness cuts down immensely. I have all other side effects like slowed breathing, less focus and ability to think clearly. not very restful sleep, i could go on but these are the main ones

These Make it SO SO much more challenging to bounce back and start thinking positively and doing things that make me happy. Does anyone else suffer from depression regularly and experience close to what i have? 

Another thing worth mentioning is that when i am not in this state, i FEEL like a different person. I sleep better i'm more confident my focus is a laser, But for the past 6 or so years it seems like my body has just gotten used to running on this depressed alternative","Recently i've been trying to find the answer/solution to my predicament by browsing google and reddit to see if others have had a similar experience. My issue pertains to gaming. 

Basically when i was younger ages 8-16 i could sit down and game for periods of time i couldn't imagine today. 15-16ish hours and i would do this almost daily and have no issues, id sleep like a baby in my offtime and rarely even eat and i was in tip top shape mentally nearly the smartest in my class. 

but recently i just cant anymore. i get an uncomfortable amount of stress from video games like (league of legends) or Rust. that give me palpitations, I can't even play for a few hours of competitive games without expecting some sort of mental exhaustion or insomnia that night. 

Has all the years of nonstop gaming wore down my mental fortitude? I'd really like to find a solution to this.",man someone please gimme some insight,"Hello once again, sadly i have returned to my old habits after a reddit post confirming my quitting. But i am once again heavily considering unplugging fully. 

For a long time now i haven't enjoyed video games, When i play video games i am minimally social much less than id like to be. For some reason i can't play games with friends and laugh and have creative conversations, all of my brain power is completely and fully sucked into the game, and i've been getting stress from games like league and fps shooters.

 earlier my buddy talked me into playing a wipe rust with them on Stevious 400 pop youtube server (full of tryhards and large groups) and my friend is not good by any means, hes a role player builder and he decided to build by launch and mil tunns early wipe when we had 3 people and we got harrassed by a zerg and it honestly just tanked my mood for the day. but the hateful thoughts i had about my friend are really what are making me realize gaming has become the opposite of what i originally sought after. 

It is just so sad for me coming to the realization i will never be able to enjoy video games like when i was young (24 now) And is even harder to fill the void of time that was usually used for gaming. Still not even sure if im ready to make this change but each reddit post and day i get closer to quitting. I just wish i could be happy and play games and thing that comes to mind is (WHY CANT I) Surely there is someway i can re kindle my energy and passion and love for games. but i know its not by continuing to play ;(

I previously was an extremely confident smart energetic child, but my family relationship was odd and i didn't get much attention so i turned to video games and played 12+ hours a day And i was happy! and ive done so since then (PROBABLY SINKING OVER 35K HOURS INTO GAMES) mostly fps shooters and its like im CRAVING the happy and positive gaming experiences i had when i was young. It really just makes me want to cry. Im just looking for some form of support or story from someone who has had a similar experience to me. :(((",Video games affect everyone differently. Don’t knock him for realizing it was a negative and deciding to better himself. Sad point of view you have,I actually found him this morning and its what gave me the resolve to make the choice. I will try my hardest to keep with it Thank you mate,"My name is Evan, im 24, and im making the decision today to go for a permanent video game detox. Video games have been a serious issue my entire life. As a kid my family was very fortunate to live in a very large house but the relationships were quite the opposite. Little did i know my mom and dad were having marriage issues, and i got 0 attention from either parent, I turned to gaming. I would sit for 10-12 hours a day as a child and play nintendo 64, then Gamecube, Then Xbox 360, Then Xbox One. Nearly everyday i wonder what my life would be like if my parents taught me lessons in life and our family were alot closer, sadly i will never know but i am making the decision to better my life from here on out. Nowadays i am completely addicted to competitive video games like Rainbow Six Siege and League of Legends. All this time i justified my gaming with the sense and thought that one day ill be a streamer or a professional gamer, for me it seemed realistic because i was extremely good at all video games. But never worked towards it because ""damn i cant stream my ping is already awful and affecting my games"" i will stream when i move and get better internet i can just record gameplay for now, but rarely ever recorded. and while procrastinating continue to play these heart pounding games an upwards of 14 hours a day. Now my brain and body is completely psychologically dependent on all the hormones and chemicals of adrenaline and cortisol from gaming. I am debating on selling my computer because its so hard the first week of quitting knowing its right there. Anyway i geuss im just posting to try and solidify this goal and maybe hear other people's success stories for motivation. Anyone else whos been left a shell of their former self due to gaming lets do it and not look back",My friend you sound to have had the exact same experience that I have actively lived for the past 6 years I’m 24 now. If you find any of those work for you I’d love to Hear about it,"Hi I hope everyone’s day is going well Today. These days have probably been the toughest for mental/physical Health for a lot of people and I hope everyone is taking care of themselves physically mentally and emotionally ❤️. I have had a very hard difficult time living since around 16 years of age. As a kid I never had any issues was always happy go lucky, Literally kicked myself out of bed every morning and I have missed those easy days so much where I didn’t have to try to feel okay. Around the start of highschool I began Experimenting with weed and had very negative effects. everytime i would I get pounding heart And pure anxiety even though I wasn’t at all paranoid. it seemed like everytime weed hit my lungs my body just panicked, post half a year to a year later from a handful of times trying to fix the reaction and The want to hang with my friends (most of them smoked) I had severe anxiety issues. it felt like my body was on high alert 24/7 (had shortness of breath and heart palpitations) stopped sleeping well and was overall at a loss. Up until then I had never experienced anxiety in my life and I began to lose nearly all of my confidence. (i was the most confident child I had known, Was At the top of the class in every Category, Fastest kid on the playground). eventually I had had enough and decided to Pursue medication. My first doc Prescribed me a purely anti-depressant drug when I was Very clear I just needed some sort of Beta Blocker. He convinced me to give it a try and this is where my life Completely flipped upside down. the medications made me feel emotionally numb, I attempted to Get off of the medication and I had intense withdrawals. Around this point I felt like a shell Of my former self, I Used to be extremely imaginative and energetic and Its like everything joyful about my Physical and mental about my ego was gutted from my brain. Luckily I made it through highschool and passed with a 3.0 (No clue how I managed this lol never studied or did homework). Here I am Years later still struggling everyday just to live. To put my Physical and mental side effects into proportion I am in great shape. 5’11 161 Lb’s and I have awful shortness of breath and Palpitations, Ive even had to cut out caffeine completely due to it giving me awful Heart palpitations. This is the main reason I am posting this after dropping some back story. Running is my life I loved to do it I ran  a 5:28 mile in highschool and rarely ran But I was athletic. But now I can barely run or excercise, When I run my whole body pulses and My throat closes up get severe palpitations and feel mentally out of it completely And it makes me extremely self conscious I can’t speak at all when I’m exercising now. This hurts me so bad 😢 because running is practically my only outlet That helps me feel better. Have any of you fellow redditors experienced Longterm Palpitations and shortness of breath 😞 Id like to know your story and how or if you Managed to Beat them.",I cant explain it any better I know what i have experienced with atleast 65% of my games full of incompetent laners. I was Silver 1 54% WR last season top lane . Btw ur reddit Names Cringe 😂,? and you Belittle poeple on reddit to make yourself feel better Also zeds early game is bad compared to so many mids so idk man you just seem angry at something and aiming it at a random reddit post,My IGN is cynical Rising btw if any of you reddit diamond prodigys want to coach me LBVS. My Mechanics are Gold 1 According to my diamond 4 friend lol,"League of legends is a great game. That being said I personally Think their Matchmaking and MMR system needs so much work. (Coming from a Hardstuck Silver 1-2) Lmao my input means nothing. This is probably such a common a post And im not really expecting any tips to climb because i Know i just need to grind 20 games a day win 12 out of 20 of those and just keep doing it But The coinflip In ranked is so real. I dont understand how in draft i meet Gold 4-2s in my lane with say 55-58% win ratio out of hundreds of ranked games, Mine is 49% btw and just wipe the floor With them, For example Last night laned against a Gold qiyana who countered my zed pick and I Made her look silly. (went 30-9) I just can not seem to climb seems like about an upwards of 60% of my games have people Auto filled playing first champs going afk and just not even caring to win. I still love the game and will continue to play and Maybe rven post an update when i hit gold But Man, The ELO hell is Real","Brother im 23 And i was in the exact same boat as you all throughout highschool. I highly recommend you get after it and fix it asap because i sat around played video games and got depressed while still having those Anxiety Derealization symptoms. Dont let it sculpt your behaviours because that will cause bad habits and bad habits lead to mental Problems. Go excercise breath Get the blood flowing meditate and if needed take a Low tier Anti depressant/anxiety deterrant like Lexapro or Something like Propranolol. Propranolol Lowers heart rate and blood pressure i take a little every now and then and it works great for anxiety which in turn also Helps Derealization. its all Anxiety Symtoms Anxiety can manifest in Hundreds of Uncomfortable symptoms. Anyways Best of luck to you my man, I Was plagued with Constant Anxiety Palpitations and insomnia in highschool And didnt get it Figured out and Methods to calm it Until Just about a few years ago. Get after it and make it your bitch Because if you dont it will make you it’s bitch. Goodluck",fPoon 😁😾,"So this is my 2nd post because i didnt really get what i was looking for. Im a 23 Year old Male That Lives at my dads currently and found an amazing Girlfriend that im so thankful for. I work  Fulltime but Anxiety is a daily thing for me. My anxiety is not triggered by thoughts. Everyone i know Says oh take CBT or Work on positive thoughts but when my Anxiety is purely all Physical symptoms not brought on by thinking and i experience them 24 7, Ive learned to co exist with it but at some times during stressful situations im not able to withstand it. Ive been on alot of medications Lexapro (SSRI that worked best for me, But my metabolism would not agree with the medication it would wear off 4 hours after taking it and i would also have mood swings on it which i have never had) Pristiq (Medication im on currently. It has been the most consistent medication ive took for anxiety, Im able to function but still not to the point i’d like to be) What seems to be the only thing that really completely alleviates my constant Anxiety is Benzos, My girlfriend gave me a klonopin once after i was having shortness of breath and persistent anxiety after smoking a blunt with her and I have never felt better in my life. It was like something in my brain clicked my body felt like it had energy again and i could think and process and express myself like never before. I pray one day i can be like normally that without the use of benzodiazepines. My Nervous system is really sensitive to medications i have awful withdrawals, So I already made up my mind i dont want to go down the Benzo Road. Anxiety is such a hinderance to me because i naturally have a high IQ i was very gifted as a child even taking math and vocabulary 4 grades ahead. But ever since highschool, Marijuana induced Panic attacks flared my General anxiety (Which i’ve had since) and i feel sluggish constantly and Its holding me back i could have so much potential. I’m very curious to hear from other people who live with General Anxiety Disorder. Im aware of nearly all cooing methods ; Meditation, Working out, and healhy diet. I’ve practiced all of the above for quite some time. I want to know of Medications like Cymbalta/other SNRI’s and or Microdosing LSD/Mushrooms Or even Hypnotherapy.  i want to know of the less conventional but most effective methods and what you do daily to alleviate symptoms!",Thanks for the reply brother man and im the exact same way caffeine Puts me in overdrive for around 30 minutes then i just crash and not a productive overdrive Just palpitations and fidgety Lmao. I have never Taken any Benzos for that exact same reason i don’t want to become dependent. Im very mindful of what causes Anxiety i keep my diet healthy Only drink water But still not To where I’d like to be. Anxieties an awful thing man Holds me back from really using all my potential,I agree whole heartedly exercise is a good one just sometimes not practical with working so much. I get into patterns where Ill hit the gym every day and them ill just drop off Lol. But i always do atleast 100 pushups a day,"So This is a huge story and i could tell it all but ill keep it short im a 23 Y/O old male. When i was growing up i was highly addicted to video games, I was Fascinated by all games and learning the quirks and outplaying people when i was 8. Video games are still a huge part of my life, In highschool i went through a rough patch and got into smoking weed with people i really did not fit in with and it caused alot of anxiety. But it seemed like weed just didn’t react with me right. Everytime i smoked weed My whole body got tense and my heart rate shot up It just made me feel on high alert 24 7. Ever since then ive had Consistent Anxiety to this day, But as a kid i was definetely more Alert and aware of external stimuli. Weed and i just dont mix. Ive been on A fair share of medication but doctors started me out on alot of anti-depressants reguardless of me explaining Purely anxious symptoms. This is where my hell started and i actually got depression from medicating Serotonin when i didn’t need serotonin to begin with. I was very Sensitive to all medications and metabolized them differently had awful withdrawals when switching meds. So i went through a good number of meds till i finally found one that works Ok Its the SNRI Pristiq. but i still have alot of Problems but at this point i don’t know if its from the medication or my Adrenal glands / Anxiety is thrown out of equilibrium from so much anxiety and random medications and chemicals being thrown at it. I experience daily brain fog, Fatigue, palpitations, Bad concentration. and Derealization where i just feel disconnected from my surroundings, I also get alot of visual problems like seeing my nose all the time and my eyes just feeling fatigued and out of focus. Propranolol has worked great But im so sensitive to medication if i take a moderately high dose the next day I have increased anxiety so i try to take small doses if needed. Anyways im Really searching for anyone whos had a similar experience with heavy Physical symptoms of Anxiety / Adrenaline / GAD and if you’ve had any successful Medications or Coping methods you have found that really work! Thank you for reading this i sincerely mean it hope you all have a good day and hope you all find peace."
SnooTangerines792,"He even said it today. We were arguing because I said I felt like he wasn't there for me when I needed him and he said he was trying. I asked him how he's trying, because I feel like he never calls or texts when he knows I'm going through things, and he said that it's hard because there's literally always something wrong with me. The thing is I spend so much time trying to take care of and manage myself and so then when I do reach out to him for help it's often filled with resentment and hurt because I had to do so much of it already alone. I spend so many nights awake late into the morning trying to pull myself out of depression and to stop the crying and be ok enough for sleep, but he doesn't see those nights. He just sees me the next day when I tell him I'm not ok. So to him I am a burden but to me I feel so alone. He told me that I always have a crisis when it's around the time his assignments are due, which I don't choose and I don't know if that's even fair to say.

&nbsp; 

I don't know how to reach out for help without feeling like a burden but I also don't know how to stop feeling so hurt and upset that I have to do so much alone. I said the worst thing today. I said that even though I would never do anything sometimes I don't want to be here anymore. Which I hate saying because it feels like it's not fair to put that pressure on him to deal with my crisis and to be my care provider, I feel like it's manipulative (even though it's true) and I feel like such a burden. I tried breaking up with him because I feel like I'm not fit to be in a relationship anymore and I'm not well, but then I get depressed because I don't actually want to lose him. I just put too much on him and I'm scared it's killing his love for me. 

&nbsp; 

I'm trying to get professional help but unfortunately I can't afford anything so I'm seeing a student counselor for free and it's not really doing much to help me. I think I need some trauma therapy or something. I wish there was more in depth care for people who can't afford $100 an hour.",I just want to reach through the screen and give her a big huge and ear rub. What a cutie.,"I wonder why he felt that Yosef going off on Clare impacted his chances with her. That's too bad that he didn't get to stick around long enough to meet Tayshia, they might have really hit it off. He seems like a really sweet and intelligent guy, I hope he's doing well and in a happy place in life!","The way Clare says that he didn't run away saddens me. Like, it's a really low bar and I know she's just joking but you can tell that joke is built on some actual insecurity. I really feel for Clare and hope that she's happy with Dale. He seems like a really solid dude, I wish them the best.","I think that many of the people on reddit who are forcefully against vegans are older and sturbbornly set in their ways, and a lot of the redditors who are forecfully arguing for veganism are really young. I definitely think that most of the people on this sub are on the younger side of reddit.",Do you mind if I ask how you feel? Do you notice any health problems or tiredness at all? I'm curious what b12 deficiency feels like and always wonder if maybe I have it and don't know (I have such a fear of my own blood and needles that I've been putting off going to the doc).,We're looking at you Starbucks!,That's adorable!,"Lol I thought I was reading the text conversation the wrong way at first, I thought the fiance was the one talking about the lotion. I was like yeah that is boring, I don't blame you girl.","My relationship is extraordinarily similar to yours (we've even been together for the same length of time), so believe me when I say I understand your frustration.

First off, I have to say only you can tell how important it is to you to have the type of conversations you want and if it's worth staying together if it never changes (be prepared for that possibility).

Second of all, have an open conversation about this and explain to him how conversing is a form of intimacy for you. It makes you feel close to him and that deep conversation is a form of vulnerability, which builds trust and love. Explain everything as straight forward as you can. Tell him how it makes you feel, tell him what he could do differently, tell him why this is important to you. Work on the issue together. 

That being said, this might just be how he is and it's a type of incompatibility that you're just going to have to adapt to. The way I look at it is that my boyfriend is a whole complex human and I may not understand why he is the way he is, or why it's so hard for him to engage in deep conversations, but I have to accept him because that's love. And love is a choice. There's no one person out there who will be your everything. We have to be our own everything's. Journal, find enjoyment in pursuing knowledge by yourself, find a community that shares the same interests, don't be afraid to grow by yourself. 

And the last opinion of mine to give is I personally think you're taking for granted his ""I love you"" texts. How does it make you feel if you imagine you guys broke up, he found a new girl, and was sending those texts to her daily? Whenever I feel like I take my boyfriend for granted I think of that and tear up and remember how frickin lucky I am that he chose me. If you think of that hypothetical situation and don't feel any sadness then I think there's something there to explore.",I actually felt awful at that part. I could be wrong but there was a look in Ed's eyes that for a second made me think that really stung. I honestly don't blame him for not playing nice with Chassen after that. If some girl called me thunder thighs you better believe I'm not going to forget about it.,Wow she looks so beautiful! And so happy!,"Oh 100%. He gloats about Harvard all in good humor so it's fair to tease him back about it. If you can dish it you can take it!  

My reply was just to the comment above that said s/he hates people who say that some people just aren't good at math - even though I'm one of those people lol.",With calculators and sleepless nights crammed full of studying for that specific moment :),"I can do simple math, but not very well in a time crunch which is when my mind gets panicky and I almost always get it wrong. Yes I met my basic math requirements (although I had to retake a math class). No, I didn't need a special accommodation for my college entrance exam. I don't see why these questions are relevant and tbh they feel pretty judgment loaded. It's fully possible to be educated, intelligent, have a life of achievement, and still be not great at math (specially within time constraints).","I don't have a learning disability and I don't think I'm stupid but I am quite awful at math. And I don't know if people think if they embarrass and judge me enough for it that I'll magically get better, but it doesn't work like that. It's true that some people's brains just aren't wired to do math fast or well. I can name many intelligent and well educated people that I've met throughout life who are similar.",Exactly! There's nothing wrong with being an influencer but I feel like she tried way too hard to dress it up as something extra and exciting.,"I like Tayshia but I died laughing when that attorney asked her what she does and she said ""I travel for work and for pleasure"". That was the most subtle way of saying ""I make money by being pretty on instagram"" while still trying to make it sound exciting.",https://pics.me.me/thumb_women-are-so-hard-to-read-well-actually-we-just-51584501.png,"Congratulations!!

Also, I'm happy that you have supportive friends around you who really care, those people are such a gift.","I absolutely love and support everything you just said, I wish I could upvote twice.","It's a bit juvenile in my opinion. Saying it once is fine, he's smitten I get it. But when he decided, like actually put time into thinking on it, that it's his favorite word for her...it just seems immature and completly bro-ish.","I don't think that's fair to criticize Ed for medical information we don't know about. Also, saying that he lifts weight is evidence that he never had an old injury is pretty riddled with misinformation. It's very possible for people to lift weights with a pre-existing injury, you just have to be careful of your limitations. Heck, my friend is a professional body builder and once had his wrist and every bone in his hand broken and he still lifts competitively.
 
And even if he didn't have a pre-existing injury he still had every right (and was smart to) not to wrestle against a guy who wanted to do serious harm to him.","This person you're replying to literally created a subreddit called ""fatphobic"".

PETA, being the dumb fuckwits they are, decided that horrific tragedy would be a great thing to make an advertisement out of (making the connection that if it's not ok to do to a person why do it to a chicken). Could you imagine being that family, who are dealing with the most brutal tragedy a family can go through and you hear that PETA wants to hijack your trauma to push their own campaign?"
lIlFlashIlI,"How do I start this umm ok so the only girl I have ever really really liked knows I like her we have texted a few times She is so cute but we have kinda stopped texting she avoids me in the hall kinda so you know what that means the girl I am absolutely obsessed with doesn't like me I think about her all the time I have to try not to cry at school I cry at night all the time she's the only girl I like she is so beautiful. I stopped watching porn a long time ago because the girls on there aren't like her sometimes I think about taking a knife and cutting my wrists I love her so much I don't want to die knowing there might have been a chance but I'm so awkward she said what are you doing to me in the hall and I paused for a second and said nothing what an idiot I just stared into her eyes and walked away. I don't want to feel like this but just the thought of not being with her. I don't want to live without her. I asked her what she thought of me (over text)and she said ""idk 😐""
I'm too scared to kill myself but I don't want to live without her. I'm not religious but sometimes I pray to God to help me but it doesn't do anything I still feel the same someone please help me",Yeah that's easy to say huh she's the only positive thing in my life but she's not even in my life so that just leaves nothing,I haven't did that in a long time honestly I just want her. She is taking over my life,talk about what how my crush is the cutest girl in the world but i can’t be with her because i’m ugly and awkward,I could kill myself then all the pain would just go away,"Just be honest for example I saw mine but I'm weird so I texted her later saying ""you are so cute""",My crush is always there unless she has an appointment somewhere,"Well I mean we haven't really talked in public other then that time but, I get really sad just thinking about all the things I could've said or done.

You just responded to my text. I love you I just don't know how to express it thank you for trying :),OMG what the heck i meant message sorry,i’m so in love with her she’s all i want she is the most beautiful girl in the world i always think about her. is she going to message me? does her friends know we have been messaging each other i wonder if she thinks about us. we  see each other in the hallway but we don’t say anything i can’t speak to her if she comes up to me that would be so amazing i wanna hear her voice again i love her. i don’t even think she has heard my voice yet. god i really hope she likes me because she is the only person i wanna see,i know how you feel i’m 17. sometimes it’s like why am i even alive if i can’t have her then what else do i have?,idk she might i don’t know her lol,"so she texted me first 2 different times. i can’t believe it when she texts me i literally shake it’s crazy but i still don’t know if it’s genuine. she is super nice so i don’t know it just feels like i have so many things wrong with me but when i look at her she just seems so perfect. i’m not the best looking but she’s texting me, it must mean something right? she’s so hard to read i never know what she’s thinking. i’m so nervous around her if it was just me and her alone then i could get to know her better.",my crush probably doesn’t even know what minecraft is she doesn’t play games :(,i really want to text her but i don’t wanna bother her. i see her at school every day how can i get over her. when dose it stop hurting it’s obvious she doesn’t like me it’s so hard to get over her. is it normal to cry this much see last time i massaged her of course she responds because she’s just being nice but i can’t massage her every night. i wish i was dead,I've told her a lot of personal things over texts things that I would never tell my friends she says she doesn't judge I've told her alot and it feels really good letting it out but we haven't talked in public. I'm a really shy person so I don't know what to do. she knows I like her a lot but she hasn't came up to me in person. I said she is so beautiful and she said I'm not that beautiful like what how can she say that she is the only girl that has ever made me feel like this. it kinda hurts tho I don't even know if she likes me I guess not. Some people that know I have been massaging her a little there like have you laid the pipe yet like what does that even mean I'm just trying to talk to her man like what is wrong with you. I love her when I think about her I think about holding her hand hearing her voice omg just seeing her I don't know what they are doing with there life but I'm just trying find someone to love well I found her but it feels like she hasn't found me.,Guys what is happening to me right now so when she texts me I feel so happy but she is so confusing I try to keep the conversation going but I don't know what to say I'm like really sad because I think she doesn't like me the whole day at school I deleted her photo's off my phone then she says hey then all these emotions just go crazy I'm sad then I'm happy and I'm sad again I don't know what's happening does she like me or not God she's making me love her so much more she liked some of my posts I'm so confused I like her so much but I don't understand her what is she doing to me,Yes of course she told me she needed one. I don't vape tho,Well I only like one girl and well I love her voice I wish she would talk to me more and I love the way her hair covers her face sometimes and when she has glasses omg so cute I can't explain it,I'm so shy she knows I like her. when she's near me I literally shake like I'm so scared. I don't even know how to talk to her I just know I can't live without her I've actually recently learned she vapes I was texting her about it and she wanted someone to buy it for her and she will pay them back if I wasn't broke I'd buy it for her. I'd let her keep the money to I don't vape but it's ok I like her so much I've never been so close yet so far from someone I've  loved before God she's responding to my texts maybe shes just being nice but I don't know. I have told her I obsess over her she knows. I would give anything to know what she's thinking God I have so much love for her I just don't know what to do with it. Thank you so much for responding to my texts even if you don't like me thank you for being so nice I can't lie tho it. Hurts thinking that we might not ever be together. I wasn't lieing I cry over you it's just this is my last year of high school and your the only girl that I've ever loved this much maybe that's why I shake because you know I obsess over you and everybody keeps telling me to just go up and talk to you but I can't. what am I even doing? look the point is I love her and she knows if she liked me wouldn't she come up to me. I know this is a mess but I'm a mess so deal with it I love her.

im_a_whovian,"I was diagnosed with dysthymia (high-functioning depression) recently and it's horrible. You're expected to function normally in society but inside you have this thing rotting you away. And it's not even like normal depression. When you're depressed, the social expectation is for you to struggle to get out of bed, to not go outside and socialize. But when you have high-functioning depression, no one knows about it. You're expected to get out of bed, shower every day, join in fun activities, socialize and generally be happy when inside you're dying.

No one knows about it. Not even my parents and I cannot even consider telling them about it. My mum will just overreact and get angry and my dad will say that there's nothing wrong me and that I need to grow a pair, as they have done in the past whenever I approached them about something. 

Today my dad got angry at me for something I said that he misunderstood the tone of. It's impossible to try and talk to him because he'll just threaten me. My mother took his side as always. I've got nothing to look forward to in life. I'm a loner, always have been, always will be. I'm an atheist so I can't turn to some imaginary friend for comfort. I haven't killed myself yet because I don't want my younger siblings and my parents to go through something like that. But inside I feel dead and I have to act and smile in order to get through life. I can't keep living like this.","I'm doing an extensive research project on serial killers and the psychology behind them.

The pressure applied on the base of the projectile would presumably give it a force equal to PA, where A is the cross-sectional area of the projectile and P is the pressure. The resultant force would be PA-mg, due to the mass not being negligible. By Newton's 2nd Law, this would give the projectile a vertical acceleration (the projectile will be angled perpendicular to the ground). The acceleration would be equal to (PA-mg)/m. Is there a way to calculate the maximum height reached by the projectile, considering it will be acted upon by a vertical acceleration provided by the pressure and the acceleration due to gravity?

I just don't do anything anymore. I feel almost chronically bored all of the time. Nothing I used to do interests me, and even then I barely did anything before. 

I didn't have money to have hobbies, and now I'm almost out of that situation. I truly just don't know what to do because nothing is interesting anymore. All I do is clean, cook, wash dishes, spend time with my cat, get trained at work (rare right now), spend some time with my husband, or watch whatever on my phone. 

I feel so bland. If someone were to ask me right now, ""What do you like to do?"" I'd look like an idiot. Some people like gardening, knitting, crocheting, sewing, doing things with their car, building things, writing, painting, etc. I don't have a thing anymore. 

And if anyone sees this and says, ""What about friends? Hang out with friends!"" I was almost completely invisible in high school and I had one toxic best friend for the entire four years.

It was painful during the time I was actually doing it, but it was a distraction from whatever else I was going through. 

Once I was done doing it and I was cleaning up, it felt sort of like a nap after a really good cry. Like before the nap your head throbs, your eyes are hot and sore, but after the nap you feel better because you've finally cried it all out. That's how it made me feel afterwards and that's why I kept doing it.","Having sex and being comfortable enough to finish when you're scared or nervous takes time. Even if it's with the right person, when you're nervous, you're nervous. It's best to communicate why you're scared, what she can do to help calm you down and what could help relax you. The more relaxed you are, the better. 

For the second question, if you mean for yourself, yes. If you mean for your girlfriend, ask her yourself. It's normal to like penetration, even from fingers. If you like it, do it. If your girlfriend is willing to do the same for you, let her if you're comfortable and vice versa if she likes it.

It can be relying on someone for support through stressful situations, and then not mentioning it to your partner. Bringing up good news to this other person, and not your partner. Relying on someone emotionally through the good and the bad instead of your partner is emotional cheating. 

Emotional cheating is still cheating. It's reasonable to end the relationship if someone's partner is doing this. It doesn't matter if it's limited at physical contact, it's still considered cheating. Justifying cheating by saying you're not being physical with someone doesn't make it okay. If that's how someone would justify it, sexting someone else other than their partner would be fine. 

Making sure to send boundaries before this becomes an issue is important. 

It is subjective though, if a partner is unemotional, cold, and unresponsive when a partner is seeking advice, validation, or emotional support and is unwilling to change, someone could be emotionally cheating and not even realize it.","Yes.

I know it's not expired yet, but this was when I was on my mom's insurance, before my name was changed, and before I got married. Where I got my eyes checked was at America's Best in Virginia. I've moved four hours away and I can't actually go in person if I had to. 

I tried looking on my account, there weren't any prescriptions listed where it should be if they were to have been listed. 

If I want my prescription for either, can I just call that location and ask for a copy? I'm not entirely sure how all of it works and I don't even know if it's something I can do on the phone. I'm also not sure if my glasses prescription is expired or not, I don't entirely even know how all of that works. 

If anyone knows anything about what I should do, I'd love to some advice. 

Another question I have is if I have my prescription for contacts on the box they come in, can I order them from any site? I've looked on some sites like 1800 contacts, America's Best, and some other cheaper sites. Would it be a bad idea to order from cheaper sites? (Like do they sell expired or old contacts? That sort of thing.)","Thank you, but I don't really know how this relates to my question. That subreddit is about personal finance. I'm just looking for cheap contacts.","So I don't really have a specific place to get my contacts since I moved. I went to America's Best the last eye exam I have, but the one I went to is 4 hours away in my hometown and it was before I got married and my name has changed since then. 

I don't have access to my actual prescription, but I have the box the contacts came in and the things that held the contacts, which both look like they have the information needed to order contacts in the right prescription, which technically isn't old yet, I don't know how to access it though. 

I even went to my account on America's Best and my prescription wasn't listed where it would have been if it were on my account. 

I'm on a budget and there's a lot of places online that sell them cheaper than the actual America's Best site, but I'm scared of getting sold wonky or expired contacts that'll mess my eyes up. 

Does anyone know of any sites they've personally used for cheaper contacts that were legit? 

As for insurance and all that, my husband's in the military, so I'm covered by whatever he has, but I have no clue if that even helps with contacts or not. I'm asking him later, but I don't think it does. Thanks in advance.","It could easily be anything else I put into the coffee to make it the way I like. Any milk, creamer, sugar, could be making me feel like crap after only drinking those things and not water. For the tea, it's probably just the sugar.","I haven’t had this issue, but thank you for letting me know! If I try different brands/types I’ll definitely keep an eye out for that.","I could do that, but if I drink that instead of water I feel like garbage later on.","I struggle with drinking enough water. I don't know why, just sometimes I don't finish an entire single water bottle unless I make myself do it. It's not an everyday thing, it's just maybe two or three times a week I just don't get thirsty for just water. I get bored of water and just want something else and end up drinking coffee or tea and then feeling like crap later on. 

Is it bad to use water flavorings (like the little powder packets or Mio) to kind of bribe myself into drinking more water? Most are either 0 calories or around 10 calories for each serving. I try not to only rely on them to drink water, but sometimes it's the only thing that keeps me drinking it.","I can't really speak on anything about infertility, I've never gone to a doctor about my ED before. Whenever I purge, and I mean even if it's like one time, my period comes late. It's always about a week late, give or take a day. So I do experience something similar like what you were saying, but I'm not sure if it's really affecting my fertility or not. 

I know ED's can cause infertility, I think it happens in more severe cases, but I could be wrong. The more stress your body is under, like a lot of exercise, weight loss, under-eating, purging, etc. could all cause your period to be late or completely stop sometimes (until you stop doing those things).","I mean, therapy is good for anyone, but I don't see how it would help him with opinions he has and the fact that he agrees with incels. I think the most you can do is talk to him about it, ask what he agrees with as far as what incels think and what he thinks. Just be cautious because anger like that can easily turn into violence.","That's great, that's a lot easier than how it was explained to me.","Thank you, I’ve never been able to understand pay periods. I think I understand it now, so thanks!!","I hope this makes sense, but since I just recently started working here I have no clue how getting paid works as far as what days you get paid for that week. 

We get paid every week on Friday. I got paid today for the first time, but it looks like it was only for one day. 

Today is 11/20/20 
I had orientation 11/11/20, which it looks like I got paid for that. 
I had two training days this week, 11/18/20 and 11/19/20. I know neither of those days were included on the check I got. 

I want to ask here before asking at my work because I don’t want to sound 1. Dumb for not knowing how this works 2. Like I only care about the money. 

Will those last two days be on the next paycheck? Is each Friday paycheck for the last week, not the current week? 

Thanks in advance.","I'm new to TJ Maxx and I've gone through orientation and one day of training. (I say we because it's me and another girl getting trained together). We're getting taught the gist of things, but not entirely how to thoroughly do things. Like if something is missing a price tag, it's damaged, etc. The lady told us what to do with the price gun, but if I had to do it myself I'd be at a loss. 

I also haven't been told where exactly I'm working. On my application I made it clear I'm interested in cashiering and maybe being in the back room. Yesterday was my first day of actual training and we were told we'd most likely get put on a register the next training we had. We haven't even been taught how to use the register. It seems obvious, but it's a completely different system than my last job, so it really isn't ""obvious"". 

So if anyone has been working at TJ Maxx for a while, how difficult is working here?

It's clear to me they aren't very organized. Yesterday I waited about 20 minutes for someone to check me in (sanitize, check my temp, check me in, etc), and to come get me for training. I was told to sign in in the break room and someone would come get me. I was in the break room until I had been in the store (including waiting, checking in, etc) for about 45 minutes. I left the room to find someone and other than cashiers, there was no one. The cashiers were swamped, so I didn't want to barge through the line and ask for them to call for someone. 

I went back into the room and the store manager asked me to come with her. She showed me where to go, which was the room I had always gone to to get trained and watch the training videos. Apparently no one gave her a number for how many people she was training and no one told her to come get me or that I was even there. 

It's always taken a while for them to check people in. Yesterday the store manager said she forgot about me and another woman twice while walking up there because she was doing some other stuff. 

My last job was just ""get here on time, clock in, go to the register we tell you to, do the cashier thing, clock out on time and leave"". This is a lot of doing things here, doing things in this section, stuff items in this section, etc. 

I'm just scared I'm going to get overwhelmed and screw something up terribly because I'm not getting trained thoroughly enough like I had expected to me.","I started a new job and I've only been to orientation and training once, today will make it the second day of training. It's in retail, it's a clothing, home goods, and furniture-ish type store. Basically Ross, but the competitor, not actually Ross. 

Anyways, the store is connected to a mall which has a bathroom, which is fine. There's one to the left in another set of stores (which I haven't found yet, but I haven't been that way, I was told there was on there) and there's another one all the way on the other side of the store. It's a good three to five minute distance/bathroom break, not counting the time to get back into the actual store. 

The bathroom inside the store right near the registers is out of service, and this irks me as someone who has a super nervous bladder. I don't drink anything at least two hours before getting there. I pee twice before driving there (I live 30 minutes away) and I don't drink anything on breaks or anything. It takes me a solid two seconds to use the bathroom. I don't fiddle around in the mirror or on my phone, I pee, wash my hands, dry my hands and get out. 

It just annoys me to have to worry about a bathroom and not taking too long and finding one to use on breaks because the one that's *right there* doesn't work. Who knows how long it'll take for them to fix it. There's not even a bathroom like, near or around the break room. I always thought there would be one there just for associates, but apparently not. I just found that weird. 

I feel like I sound like a brat. It's an embarrassing thing to worry about though.","I haven't thought about that, I'll try and give that a shot and see what it looks like. Thanks!",Thank you. I'm working on getting him fixed asap since I can't imagine it being anything other than uncomfortable. I've made a few appointments so hopefully I'll get a call back to verify the date of him getting fixed soon.,"Right. I'm working on getting him fixed, but there's only so much I can do when vets aren't taking new people/pets yet because they're all catching up and behind on their current pets.","Before I even start, I am planning on getting my cat fixed. A lot of vets in my area aren't taking anyone new yet, so I'm waiting until they are accepting new pets. 

I adopted my cat about four or five months ago. He was already like 6 months or 8 months old. He wasn't a baby or a kitten, he was grown. He has vaccines, he's just not fixed yet. 

When I first adopted him he was super quiet, curious, he didn't meow a lot, he didn't pee anywhere other than his litter box, he was getting used to where we live. He's also only an inside cat. 

In the last two or three months he has been yowelling. It's a long, drawn out meow. He's not in pain from what I can tell. If I go up to him, he stops. If I pick him up, he stops. If I pet him, he stops. I give him attention, I don't ignore or mistreat him. I play with him often. 

He's also has an issue with peeing in random areas. A lot. He's peed on a soundbar I had. He's peed on a suitcase I had. He's peed on my stairs, pillows (on the floor), on clothes (on the floor), and two places especially, which are the tub on on one specific place on my *kitchen counter.*

I clean it asap with every cleaner possible along with bleach. He still does it on that one specific spot on the counter and the tub. 

I keep his litter clean. I've changed litters. I change his litter out often. 

I've looked up the symptoms of a UTI in a cat and he doesn't show any of those signs. He's just meowing a lot and peeing in places he shouldn't. 

He's also seen stray cats outside of my house. He can see them through windows in the front of the house and sometimes they come to the back doors that are glass. I'm not sure if that affects him peeing or acting out, but the time between him starting this and seeing them don't match up. 

&#x200B;

Is this because he's not fixed? Is there something else I should be looking out for? He doesn't seem to be in pain, but I'm just confused on what to do.",Thank you!,Ohh okay thanks! I'll definitely look for that.,"If you're truly 14F, you need to be careful on this type of subreddit posting things like this. People can be creepy. Just be careful."

TotallyJustABot,"For those that don't want to hear my story, here you go, I'll make it easy for you; I'm an overdose survivor. 

Now for those that do:

Friday, October 23 I overdosed on a significant amount of both Benadryl and alcohol. 

Never been that depressed of a person, and I honestly don't remember what all happened that night. 

I lost 2 days of my life that I'll never get back, and all of a sudden it was Sunday and I'm laying in some hospital bed in a psych ward, with a false name for my security.

I was hooked up to IVs for roughly 4 days, before finally being transferred to a crisis unit. It would have been maybe 2 days, but my hospital and my psych team were absolutely terrible. 

The long and short of my diagnosis: my body metabolized most of what I ingested to the point where I was of no life threat. If my body hadn't, I was told I would have been dead 5 minutes into the ambulance ride.

From this hospital I was transferred to a crisis facility for another 7 days which was absolute hell. 

Now I actually got ""downgraded"" in threat level at this point, so I was put in the more ""relaxed"" wing of the unit. Didn't help shit.

I was honestly scared for my life the entire time, staff and Drs were 0 help whatsoever, and I was not put on any meds to help with anything. I could go on and on about this place, but it's honestly just not worth it.

I got discharged yesterday, and I now have a new outlook on life: life's too damn short!

To clarify, my girlfriend does have a record, but she is nowhere near the same person she was during that time. So anything they found would be of no surprise to me. 

Knowing this conversation would come up, I decided to record it to have anything on record if they decided to try something (law enforcement-wise). 

During the conversation, there was so much BS that was just made up, that I had, had enough because I know what the truth was and my family was just trying to scare me out of not seeing her anymore. That was blatantly obvious.

By the end of the conversation, they saw I had recorded it and I was given 2 options:

1. To stop seeing her and to live my parents lives

Or 2. Continue seeing her on my own

I've had enough BS over the years from my family and I know the only way I can grow is to not be sheltered by them anymore. I need to be me, not their image of me. So I left.

He's not that stupid","He's not threatening, he's bluffing to build a narrative. Not even Trump is that stupid","That's a really interesting theory! 3.33 might bring answers to that since it seems it'll be an unvieling of SEELE. I still don't see why they'd need a proxy though. They seemed to communicate to the pilots directly mentally, and Kaworu taking a human form of someone who doesn't exist (at least in the franchise).","Kaworu states that he is destined to merge with Adam, it's his destiny to destroy mankind - so that is his inherent goal. I saw it that he chose for Shinji to kill him because he was run into a corner where he either has to become God through merging with Lilith, starting instrumentality, or have Shinji kill him.

Yeah I mostly took it that they were trying to trick him to merge with Lilith, but they instead blatantly tell Kaworu that Adam is merged with Gendo. Kinda makes the trick fall flat.

I guess my issue mostly comes with that line. I feel Kaworu isn't stupid and would've connected the dots for himself.","I think that still meant he'd have gone on living by being more formidable. He probably would've started heading for Gendo if he could, but he was at a dead-end and had to choose either insrumentality or being killed by Shinji.

That ending doesn't mention Unit2, but I find it weird SEELE would want to become a God together. I thought they wanted pure instrumentality. For Kaworu to do something like that he'd need to be a fresh clone (if he were like Rei).","http://www12.soul-anime.us/watch/neon-genesis-evangelion-episode-24/

Go to 12:35. Some of it might not be added scenes, but just looking at the detail of some shots it seems added in",Then why did they put Nerv at such a disadvantage?,"It sounded like SEELE was telling Kaworu they want him to merge with Adam and destroy mankind, that they said that's the lilim's hope. Kaworu laughs at them saying that which makes sense since he doesn't think Shinji wants to die. But the reality is the Adam was actually Lilith, so merging with it now would incite instrumentality. Kaworu wants to merge with Adam. If he could, I think he would've fought Shinji back up to Central Dogma to get Adam's body from Gendo.

Take note though Gendo doesn't hold a copy of Adam, but his ""resurrected body"". I assume Adam and Lilith cannot be destroyed without merging with eachother.

But what makes this not make sense is SEELE telling Kaworu Gendo has Adam's body. The issue is that they aren't tricking him at that point, they're actually pointing him to man's destruction.

And SEELE never speaks of Unit01s importance before it eats the S2 engine. They never say directly they're interested in it solely because it's a piece of Lilith. It's the fact it's a hybrid that scares it. I suppose they were hoping a desperate fight between Kaworu and Unit01 would lead one of them to starting instrumentality.     ","I got torrent from NYAA, but sadly site taken down. Lucky I got just a week before. If you know a method of uploading a file I can send u my ep24. My dropbox is too stuffed tho","I never took it that Gendo and Fuyutski thought Kaworu merging with Eva2 would cause Third Impact. I think they just thought doing so would make him too formidable for just Shinji to handle. They say, ""do u think it'll merge with unit 2"", which Gendo responds, ""OR will it destroy us all"".

I don't get what u mean third paragraph. ""Eva2 has SEELE treating""?

Before the director's cut addition I always took it that SEELE told Kaworu Adam was in Terminal Dogma when he was actually with Gendo. That becomes a legitimate trick. I also took it that they weren't relying on Adam or the Angels because there is now more pieces involved, being the Evas. I thought Kaworu merging with Lilith would have same effect as Rei in EOE to which Unit01 is the catalyst again. That's the most sensible thing I've come up with, but you have to ignore the line where SEELE tells Kaworu Gendo has Adam's body.","I don't see how being built from Adam and being a clone of Adam is the same thing. I also thought Unit 0 was made from Lilith from how Rei deals with it. She seems to have trouble syncing early on due to her existential crisis of not wanting to acknowledge her other forms, Unit 0 seeming to be one. Evageeks says it's unknown though, so I guess that detail's for interpretation.

What makes Unit 01 special is not that it's made from Lilith but that it ate the S2 engine that seems to make it able to be part of the catalyst for an instrumentality.

But beyond that, things just don't seem to add up as to why SEELE wouldn't just tell Kaworu that Adam's resurrected body is locked in Terminal Dogma instead of being merged with Gendo. I don't see why/how there'd be two Adams, and if there was an identical copy, it'd likely act the same as EVA 02 in terms of how Kaworu deals with it.","VHS is going for the thousands! Sell sell sell!!!

http://www.ebay.com/itm/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-Complete-Collection-VHS-1998-/162503979731?&_trksid=p2056016.m2516.l5255","VHS is going for the thousands! Sell sell sell!!!
","I took it that there is one Adam and his descendants who want to return to him. When the resurrected Adam fetus was in the fleet of cruise ships, that is the only time an Angel went for a place beyond the Geofront (volcano one doesn't count since it was attacked as it appeared). So, when Gendo merges with the Adam fetus, I'd assume the Angel's target is now Gendo.

SEELE states Kaworu holds Adams soul and Gendo his body.","If they wanted Unit 01 to start it alone, wouldn't it be better for Kaworu to have merged with it when Shinji wasn't in it? SEELE must've known all the pilots were children of the mother-merged EVAs, so allowing the pilot to be on-board puts their plan at risk from the get-go. I guess Kaworu was taking things into his own hands though.

But mostly I don't get how their plan fooled Kaworu, or if they were even trying to fool Kaworu. They tell him out-right that Adam's revived body is merged with Gendo and Kaworu acknowledges it. Kaowru also says his goal is to merge with Adam. And if Kaworu actually wanted to merge with Lilith still, he still says it'd kill mankind - so why would SEELE want that?","The director's cut added scene only confuses me further. The added scene makes it seem Kaworu already knew Adam was merged with Gendo, yet he still went for where Lilith was. But mostly I don't get SEELE's motive for sending Kaworu inside Nerv. It sounds like they wanted Unit 01 to be used, but what did they gain from that? It also sounded like they hoped Unit 01 killed Kaworu, as if they didn't want Kaworu to unknowingly merge with Lilith (that being when they say ""I pray Unit 01 will accomplish it's task"").

So do they want Kaworu to go to Lilith, become God or something and merge mankind?

Or do they want Unit 01 to kill Kaworu and... ya?

Or maybe they want Unit 01 to merge with Kaworu? Idk",I'm pretty sure the VN Steel Girlfriend has that background sound in loop,"I kindof agree.

Rubicon2020,"I've been depressed for more than half my life it's gotten better over the years. This week has not been the case. I have a wonderful husband and I have a nice family. We all currently live under one roof. All is fine. I'm in a 2nd career type schooling right now. Almost done, come on May. The one thing that makes me happy is graduating.

Here lately, the only happiness I get out of life is going to school and talking with my professor about life, IT, protocols, what I don't understand in the classes, and sometimes his health. It's a funny conversation lol. But that's the joy in my life right now. At home my life sucks. My husband is either working, sleeping, playing on his computer, watching tv, or eating. We don't talk unless it's about his work, his past girlfriends/fiance, all the wonderful times he's had as a teen and 20-30 something. We met when he was 39 and I was 26. Been together almost 10 years. Love him to pieces and wouldn't leave him for the world, but I just like having the connection of being friends with other guys and gals. I have several classmates that are friends; well, friendly. 

I like waiting until everyone leaves the classroom to talk with him because I learn so much in just casual conversation. Learning where he's been, what IT jobs he's done, how to do more in-depth on routers and switches and asa's. I get this excitement and joy just listening to him because I know ultimately I'm learning. Sometimes we talk about his new roof he's got solar, his health he's not the best at taking care of himself lol, he loves his kids which is awesome not a lot of men I know actually do. He loves his wife which is awesome...again not many men I know do that, always complain about the significant other, or beat them (not mine). Never say a nice thing about them. I love my husband. It's not a sexual feeling, but it is a sort of emotional connection, and I feel like when I talk to him I'm cheating on my husband. My husband has no flipping idea what I go to school for. He doesn't understand it. He has no interest in it. When I try to talk to him about it he just ignores me and just goes on watching tv, or continuing a conversation with himself. 

Right now my classes are Weekdays 7-10pm and Sat 8a-1p basically. He's every class professor. I chose these classes because I love his teaching style and I've learned so much from him compared to other professors. Some don't even lecture then hand out exams like the material is supposed to make sense. And forget asking questions they leave the classroom after 20 minutes and go home and never respond to email. Or they speed through a lecture then give a crap of a study guide and hand out exams all willy nilly. But never really go over the concept of all this. This guy he goes over it until you understand it. I just learn so well from him. He's not bad looking, quite cute, but don't have that type of interest in him. I want his knowledge. I just really love talking to him. My husband doesn't care he wouldn't even care if I cheated on him. I'm not thinking about it, I'm not doing it, I'm just saying he wouldn't care. He's just into his own little world. Most of the time it's fine cuz I'm in mine, but here lately I just want to have conversations on things that interest me, my life, what I'm learning. If you don't get it let me teach you so I can understand it even more.

I told him (husband) today that I am feeling unwanted and explained to him that I thought I was having a heart attack the other night apparently I was having a panic attack and what caused it fuck if I know cuz I was having a grand ole time playing with my ASA. And the most someone cared about it was my professor and it wasn't even that much. My sister was like it's just a panic attack, my mom was like it's just a panic attack, my husband didn't even know because he was sleeping. I went to the ER because like I legit thought I was having a heart attack, like I've been under a lot of stress here lately and I'm just like ""I'm coming Elizabeth!"" feeling. And everyone just brushes it off. I mean hell so did I once my blood pressure came down from 160/100 to my normal of 90/70 and the chest pain stopped, I was like it's just a panic attack I get it...now. But in the middle of it he's the most concerning one. Like husband doesn't answer text messages no cuz he's got to be sleeping before 7pm even though he was off the following day and slept in until noon. YES he slept that long. Then, when I told him about the ER visit his exact words were ""ok"". So I cried on my husbands shoulder and he told me he wanted me and loves me and will try to do better. I know he won't he never does. 

I would love to just spend a few hours talking to my professor and taking notes on just things he's done with IT stuff. It's more knowledge than you'll learn in a textbook and I find it interesting. And that's my joy in life right now. Other than that my life sucks. It's 5pm and I have 2 hours till I go to class and I'm counting down the minutes. Knowledge is power.

&#x200B;

TL:DR: I'm enjoying talking to my professor about class, life, jobs, other stuff and the rest of my life sucks and yet I feel like I'm emotionally cheating on my husband when we get into these conversations (professor and I).","I’ve known this woman for apparently 10 years which doesn’t quite make sense cuz I’ve known my husband for 11, but met 10 years ago. But her father died 10 years ago and she broke down to me when it happened. So either my years are getting confused or I’m just confused. Idk not the point. 

For 5 of these ~10 years we’ve had this kind of girlfriend relationship but never done the deed. Family is the reason our families are friends and have hissy fits when we try to be close. For financial reasons we are both living with our parents currently. So they think they can rule us. 

So like a couple weeks ago I just asked how she was cuz it had been a minute since we last chatted. And it started a frantic text messages of basically sexting for a week. And we planned to meet up and yes my husband is 1000% for this. We have a weird relationship. I consider myself a lesbian in a hetero relationship lol. But anyways, it didn’t happen. Which is normal it’s never happened this is prolly the 5th time it’s fallen thru the day before it was supposed to happen. Me I’m like basically heartbroken because I really like her. 

Now she just doesn’t want to even say hi to me. I’m feeling unwanted from everyone until they want something and stupid me does it every time. Every time she texts looking for someone to basically get off too it’s me and I am happy to “help” but I just want to have a relationship and not just some sexting fuck buddy. Then being ignored for months until she’s horny again. 

My husband told me to not give up on this type of relationship, but to give up on her. My best friend agreed with my husband. And I do too, but stupid me gets sucked right back in every time. 

I wish meeting women weren’t so hard and I didn’t have anxiety and had some social skills to go out and find someone better. 

And she’s my friend, well sort of, I don’t want to block her cuz then I feel bad and then I miss her.  I’m stupid!","I’m not sure if it’s the flu, cold, or just allergies as I’m allergic to all the shit in Austin, Tx. So today I was blowing my nose, sneezing, and coughing great can totally deal it sucks but no big deal. Then this evening my sister who is worse than I was decided she’d cough and breath all over me while sitting at school waiting for class. (Both college students)

So I get worse and the congestion hits, more sneezing, less coughing. I’m already wearing a hoodie in 90 degree weather cuz I have to typically stay warm/hot so I can keep congestion away. She goes off to class finally. And I get agitated over getting worse. I’m not feeling well having to listen to bullshit conversations with her. Finally it’s quiet. My professor says I can go on in even tho it’s not my class time and there’s a class on computers but desks are free. So I do. 

It gets worse! Everything has multiplied by a hundred and I’m just frazzled, agitated, and that’s when it happens...anxiety creeps in cuz one nostril is closed 95% and getting that blockage of ear canal when you swallow. I have a panic attack, but trying to remain calm. No one sees me. I’m hyperventilating. I can’t breath even tho I am, I’m breathing thru my mouth, but I am breathing. I bolted walked fast to my car and waited for my sister. Within 5 minutes my professor emails me, 

“You doing ok? I noticed you left.” And honestly, it was the most heartwarming email I’ve had in a long time. I’m happily married, I have a wonderful husband and not in some weird infatuation thing for a guy no he’s like twice my age. No, it just made the anxiety attack lessen that i didn’t say bye to someone and they noticed I left. I’m always the last one to leave at the end of the night. I’ve gotten to know my professor on a personal level with his health and mine. We both lost someone dear to us this past summer. And he’s just a great mentor and professor. 

It just felt nice. Of course I let him know just having some allergy issues. 

Then, I get home. Take some afrin that’s some bullshit. Didn’t help. My hubs who was sleeping, he has to be up 430 for work. I’m having another anxiety attack cuz I can feel the pressure in my head and I’m breathing but it feels like nothing is being taken in. I wake him and tell him to talk to me for a bit. I feel bad, but he totally understands. He’s seen me go thru this for now 10 years a couple times a year. He told me all about his day and he gave me his bottle of equate “Afrin” and boy that stuff works! I can breath in my nose mostly now. It’s runny again, I know gross. But the panic attack has moved on and I think I can go to sleep now. 

Just wanted to kind of vent about my loving husband and my panic attacks tonight over congestion. I feel like such a baby when it comes to being congested.","SORRY not Peer Reviews, Job Reviews. Dumbass me didn't pay attention.

&#x200B;

Like title says, not in the field yet and I'm not asking for like a ""how can I get paid higher faster"" type thing. I'm seriously curious.

I've had a production review I think is what they called it. My manager reviewed my calls, job skills, what I was doing properly yada yada yada. Sadly, this other manager bad mouthed me cuz I wouldn't do her departments job. So my review was crap. But HOW do you go into that with a decent or awesome review and negotiate 20k more in salary? Like I've only heard of like a 2%, or $0.15 raise not like 20k. I mean I get if you make a lot you could potentially get that with a 5% or something raise, but if you're making $25k how would you negotiate a potential 25% raise to make $31k?","Getting my homelab together for CCNA and also for CCNP when I get that far. First thing I have is a Cisco ASA 5505 coming bought on eBay. I’ll be hitting up the goodwill electronics online auction site for a Cisco router and switch this afternoon. 

The problem is I don’t want to go live with it. I’m not wanting to hook it up to my home router to make it work officially. Although that would be cool, I’m just not that confident I won’t screw something up royally. I’m about to graduate in May and I’m not confident enough in my abilities yet which is why I’m trying to build a homelab. 

I know I can just plug up to laptop and electricity and run some configurations and not have to hook it up to Ethernet. But would I learn better IF I did hook it up? I mean it would suck for me to have to troubleshoot it for some cataclysmic error and not know how to fix it. Will just running configurations on it be enough? To do ccnp when the time comes?","Tonight I am behind on an ASA firewalls lab. I’m a computer IT student. lol I couldn’t go to lab last week cuz of an issue I had so I’m behind one lab. I needed so much help tonight it wasn’t even funny. I was so confused. And these stupid instructions don’t help. Always talking about cables to plug in and change settings. Granted I need to do this for my future job so I need to learn. This was a new lab and I’ve never used these cords or switches before so I was so confused with what goes where. 

There was this other student who’s asa got fried and the professor was helping them for majority of the class which I get it’s going to be like that sometimes. Then we had a DHCP issue to where someone and I swear to God it was me, plugged in the wrong cord and commands and caused the computer lab’s internet to cut out. We never found out who it was, but my anxiety says it was me. Then, I get to a point where I’m lost like 1000% and don’t know what to do. And this other student (not original other student someone else) just wouldn’t shut the fuck up constantly talking about bullshit and loudly. 

And I almost cried cuz I couldn’t get any help, I was having sensory overload with so much noise, high anxiety from me not being able to figure it out, then earlier today my dogs got into a fight and one is a 15lb chihuahua the other is a 95lb German shepherd so that anxiety was still high and I just shut down. I didn’t finish my lab. I screwed up on it. I have to redo it. 

Talked with my professor after class and he said not to worry too much because we can’t break them, if we have to redo setup, we just redo setup. Repetition will get me where I want to go. And to come to school earlier and just play with the asa and work with it and it’ll get better. 

So, I just needed to kind of decompress here. I have a prescription for alprazolam but I can’t take it because the pharmacist told me I could die because I’m also taking flexiril and they do not mix at all. So I couldn’t take one and calm down I had to ride the tide and I just about either cried or just got extremely pissed off and threw something lol. But I managed to keep it together long enough to save my configuration and then put everything away and walk calmly out. 

I’m worried this is going to happen in my job and I’m going to be fired for being unfit. Which causes more anxiety because my husband and I can’t live on our own without me having a job. And I love what I’m learning, I enjoy the labs typically. I think I should have just stayed home tonight after the dog fight and relaxed instead of leaping into class but there’s only so many lab days we have. 

Anywho my meds are finally kicking in. I can finally relax and go to bed.","I really suck at scripting and programming all together. Somehow I helped my husband with his Python homework, he had completely different homework than I did so I had to remember how to do it. And for some reason it came to me and I showed him correctly. But that was about how many cookies you can make per cup's of sugar, butter, and flour. I did my python on accounting and using a cash register of sorts.

This semester I'm doing Unix II and we are doing scripting.

""Scripting is Fun!""

""Man Bear Pig Dog Cat Sheep""

But as of so far and as far as our scripting labs go NOTHING about how to automate in real life settings. Like why would I need to learn how to write a script for ""Man Bear Pig....."" Why oh Why can't they make it at least somewhat real life, everything else is. Routers Labs, ASA Labs, Adv Routing and Switching, Windows Server, Novell, but when it comes to programming and scripting it's bullshit.

My brother told me about a windows program called ""Auto-It"" and I have a Mac. I haven't done my Windows VM yet. I'm kind of really busy with classes. Hopefully over Christmas break I can do it. But is that it? Is there somewhere, online I can go to learn scripting. I would like to be a Network Engineer and of what I've been told scripting is A LOT of what you do, but yet they don't do any scripting that will be helpful at least to me. 

Awesome thing I did was troubleshoot my own GNS3 lab last night, I couldn't get my hosts to route across OSPF routing and it's cuz I had it shutdown. Took me 15 minutes lol I was so confused why it wouldn't work. Then I ran show run and bam I seen it. It's not much, but it was HUGE for me. I'm two semesters from graduating and I feel like I'm the dumbest person in this field. Then, I help my sister with her networking homework, my husband with his programming homework, I'm answering questions silently in the hall waiting for my class and he's teaching either TCP/IP or Fundamentals of Networking. So I kind of know what I'm doing, I just feel like an idiot. 

But any help in scripting for reals would be helpful. I can't even figure out how to get started. It's just French to me and I don't speak French. Sometimes English and I have issues. lol","Been with my husband (truly just boyfriend) for 10 years and after having sex about once a week for 6”5 years to have a baby and finding out we can’t, fertility issues on both sides. We just gave up on sex. And honestly, our relationship has blossomed SO much in the last 5 years. We don’t argue, we don’t get frustrated over not having sex all the time. Like legit it’s been nearly 5 years lol since we last had sex and we both couldn’t be happier. 

People find it weird we are in a serious relationship and live with a dead bedroom and that we couldn’t be happier. I’m asexual he’s just tired all the time, has low T, but docs won’t prescribe T for him cuz he’s a diabetic who sometimes refuses to take his meds and it could make it worse. Thankfully, he’s finally getting it under control, but I don’t see us really ever having sex again. We are both attracted to each other, we love each other to pieces, but we just don’t have sex. We’re still intimate but it’s just like snuggling and cuddling together and being more aware of each other’s feelings, thoughts, wishes, goals, dreams. 

I often hear comments like “how can you not have sex?” And for me it’s just a gross feeling. Kind of religious related for me. I was always told growing up “God and your dead relatives are always watching over you!” So like that planted an OCD thought of “oh God they see me having sex!” And of course I do have OCD and it weirds me out to no end. And yet I’m NOT religious. In fact, I absolutely despise religion, it’s man made and has many flaws, but I do believe in God. 

I guess we are rare?

Edit: I joined this sub with my first reddit account a few years ago and ended up hating my “name” so I changed a few months ago and decided to join again. When I first joined I was a little upset that we didn’t have sex. Then, after joining I realized it’s cool. We don’t need too to be happy. We used to argue all the time. Now we barely get annoyed with each other. Life is much better for us without. Well thanks for the kind words.","I don’t own a Jeep Wrangler yet, but will next year after I graduate. I read on here that if you jack it ta Jesus and put big tires on it that it changes the speedometer? How would one go about recalculating that? I’m wanting a 3-4 in lift with around 35” wide tires.",I'm looking to get CCNA cert. if I take the ICND1 and ICND2 do I get CCNA R&S cert or just INCD1&2 certs? I'm not sure how it works. I'd like to get ICND1 and then ICND2 because I can afford them separately lol.,"I'm graduating in May with an Associates and there's plenty jobs in my area that require just an associates. I want to get a couple certs before I graduate. I'm leaning towards CCNA and RHCSA or MCSA. I'd prefer MCSA as I know how to run a Windows Server and to me it's easier than Linux servers. I've only started a class to work with Linux servers. I should create my own for home lab and learn it, but I don't. I have a disc that has RedHat 6 on it. I just got yesterday, purchased a book from Half Price and it came with it. Would I be better off trying to get the newer version instead of 6?

My first job I'm hoping will be desktop support for the State of Texas as there are plenty of jobs listed right now...hopefully they'll have plenty when I graduate as well. They are full time and I can't do full time because of classes. I would like to move into a SysAdmin or Network Admin position within a couple years. I think the State uses Windows if I remember the job descriptions. They are merging into the Cloud systems for a lot of their stuff. And then I'd like to also work with Cisco's Routers, Switches, and/or ASA's. I find configuring and troubleshooting via CLI with Cisco's equipment fun. 

Which certs would be beneficial for my career? Network+, CCNA, MCSA, RHCSA, RHCE, Cloud+, AWS, Google Cloud? Anymore. The job descriptions I'm looking at don't specify which certs they want or need they don't really list any certs at all. Just specific degrees either Associates or Bachelor's and 90% are Associates or higher.","Had a flare up about a month ago and I'm still dealing with it; it's so frustrating. I walk as much as I literally can which ISN'T MUCH cuz it hurts like hell. I stretch as much as possible which isn't much cuz it hurts like hell. I sit an awful lot, but it's either sit or lay down the only relief I can get. I don't understand how most people get relief from standing and walking. Like, not me, not at all. Walking and standing put me through the roof with pain. My legs get wobbly and after a couple minutes I have to sit otherwise I will literally fall. We are NASCAR fans and I was walking to the other room and the Prayer before the race came on and I stopped to bow my head and pray along, it wasn't that long of a prayer and I had to keep my eyes open so I wouldn't wobble over and I was so ready for it to be over by the time the announcer said 'prayer'.

My doctor prescribed me 10mg of cyclobenzaprine a 3x10 day and I went through it in about 15 days, tried only taking it twice a day then some days 3. She, bless her, gave me a refill for another 3x10 day supply. I take one when I wake, one during mid day, then one at bed time. I'm gonna have to slow down on them cuz I don't see her for another 15 days so I need to make them last. Hopefully, she'll just give me some for a monthly supply. My previous doc did he gave me RX for 3x30 day. I took myself off them because I was taking it along with some strong pain meds and I was failing classes and spent a year's worth of semesters failing. Finally, I just took myself off. I'm still trying to graduate. But it's not making me tired, it's just making me where I can be a human. 

Like I yelled at my dog for barking at the neighbors again, and just that pulled my back muscles to spasm. Like WTF! I didn't move. It's hard as fuck to shower. I already have a shower chair cuz I've fallen several times in the past 3 years; broke down and decided if I'm gonna feel 85, might as well get the shower chair. But it's getting over the wall of the bathtub to get in and out that hurts so bad. I take lots of ""whore baths"" which is what my mom calls them. Baby wipes galore and fresh clothes. My hair stays super short so it doesn't get greasy as bad. I shower maybe once a week and that's forcing myself to just suffer through the pain and just do it. Then, I have to just lay down for the rest of the day which is typically night time anyways. I have to also have my husband help me in and out of the shower. He holds my hands and makes sure I'm balanced. So, I have to wait till he's home to shower. 

I have LOTS of weight to lose. I'm 340lbs, I've lost almost 40lbs this year. My diet has changed dramatically and I can't exercise any, but that's ok it's 80% diet 20% exercise, at least that's what I hear. I go to school Mon-Thur nights and Sat mornings so I walk to and from classes, which really isn't much plus my doc gave me handicap parking placard (Thank God). But it's still a walk. Chairs KILL the back. I graduate in May I'm happy to be graduating, but then I have to get a job and I'm like how tf am I supposed to walk around job sites? Am I going to be in a wheel chair soon? Will I continue to lose weight and it help? My future is unknown at this point. 

My doc asked me about some symptoms and I do have one. I can't feel when I pee; like there's no feelings down there of peeing. I just know I'm done because there's no more sound in the toilet. It's I guess numbing, I was going to bring it up on the 20th appt. And I have to constantly pee. Like I can drink one sip of drink and within 20 minutes I'm in the bathroom. I've checked my glucose thinking it's super high cuz that's what happens to my husband and I am a diabetic now, and I'm keeping it around 90-100 so it's not high. So, I'm not sure why I'm peeing all of a sudden WAY more than normal. And it's like all of a bam! must go, if not have to take a shower. I have an overactive bladder to begin with since I was 8 so I take a pill for it Oxybutynin. If I didn't take it I'd pee in my pants before I could cross the hall to the bathroom. So, I don't know if it's just getting worse or if it's incontinence related to spine issues.

I'm only 35. Like wtf is my life going to be. I have no way of going to specialists, no job and no insurance and self-pay is expensive as hell where I live. My husband can put me on his insurance at work, but that's $600 a month we don't have. So I go to a community clinic; which is still $55 for a visit.

TL;DR

I really just needed to vent and complain a little. I'm not allowed at home to do because others are ""worse off"" than I am.","I read the wiki and faq. I’m doing a low carb (moderate) 40 fat 40 protein and 20 carbs. I want to be able to eat my rice pasta and rice. Both is brown rice. I have an allergy to wheat and gluten among so many other things. With the 40:40:20 I can fit in 1/2 cup (dry) of rice pasta a day or 1/2 cup (dry) rice. 

Right now my plan is:

2-3pm: eat 6-8 hard boiled eggs no seasonings but I’m thinking about adding salt. For the protein. 

4-5pm: 
eat small dinner of rice pasta Mac n cheese with a meat and some side veggies. 
Or rice with meat and a veggie. 
Or riced cauliflower, meat, and another veggie. 
(My portion of meat is small which is why I have the eggs).

Then fast the rest of the time. I will be drinking either Pepsi Zero, Coke Zero, or Splenda sweetened tea until I run out of it then stevia sweetened tea but it’s lightly sweetened. Like 2 tsp for a 30 oz cup. Almost got it down to just no sugar and just go unsweetened. Which I may do in the next month or so. Or not. 

I know I should get a decent amount of protein I was told in the Keto sub to max out protein. Fat and Carbs are limits. I think that’s what I learned, but I don’t want to go strict Keto cuz I want to enjoy my foods as well. 

I’ve done this now 3 days in a row and I’m a little hungry in the morning or around bedtime, but I just ignore it with a drink and do something else. Thankfully school is about to start up again so I’ll be busy and won’t worry about food. 

Do I need to reach a certain amount of calories. Carb Manager has me at 1800 something so do I need to reach that? If I eat what I have planned to eat I’ll only be at 1200 something. But today’s is a little more cuz I had a damn donut (it was a rough day).  I don’t want to be so low that my body feels like I’m starving it and it keeps me fat. Where should I land? I know everyone’s different but a little guidance is more than welcomed. 

Thanks.","I am looking to purchase either a Surface Pro 6 16gb, i7, 512gb ssd; or the Surface Book 2 same specs. I'm going to be using it in class to record lectures and take notes, but mostly take notes by hand while surface... records the lectures. 

What does a photo look like with a surface pro 6? It angles down is there a way to get it to sit up nearly straight and still use the laptop mode? I don't want to have to hold it the whole lecture as that would 1. be weird, and 2. defeat the purpose of taking notes and recording the lecture at the same time.

I have the student pricing so I have just at $2300 to spend on it which will get me either one with Surface Pro 6 being the cheaper one and including the type touch keyboard.

I only have 2 semesters left so it will also be doing loads of VMs and lots of time studying for IT certifications as well. That's why I'm leaning towards the surface pro 6 because I can use it as a tablet at night before bed. Watch tv or continue to study until I pass out lol. I just need it to be able to record lectures? That's my only issue.

Any input is welcomed. Thanks In Advance.","I keep reading on here about students taking 15-18 credits and then working part time or even full time. I’m over here with 9 credits and no working cuz it’s difficult and I failed the first time I did that. I know some classmates, well most of my classmates work full time but they end up only having 3-9 credits a semester. We are in community college, but still. I don’t know how you guys, and gals do it. 

I worked part time which turned into full time hours half the time during my first semester until my 3rd and I made C’s and F’s gpa bottomed ya 1.152 and I finally had to just do one class at a time until my gpa got back over 2.0. I got fired from my job and went to school full time. I’m almost done I graduate in May. But damn if I could have taken 12-15 credits each semester I could have been done long ago. 

I know we study at our own pace, but damn I feel dumb.

Edit: Thank you for the kind remarks. I get we go at our own pace. It’s just crazy for me to understand how someone can do so many credits per semester and work full time. Or even part time. I struggle with 3 classes and I spend hours a day studying and still struggle. I have that “butterfly” syndrome lol so it takes a lot for me to sit still and do work. You guys are awesome!","Edit: 
I’m starting to wonder if I don’t have sciatica. Most posts talk about how standing and walking upon flare up helps a great deal. I can’t stand or walk when I have a bad flare up. Laying down helps tremendously which is why I’ve been in bed for over 2 weeks. I’m up and about today but not pushing myself yet. I did two days ago and got sent to day 1 yesterday. 

—————

I went to the doctor last Friday. She put me on meloxicam and cyclobenzaprine for my sciatic flare up. I typically take four 200mg ibuprofen at a time 2-3 times a day and I get a little relief but not a lot. So she wanted to try me on meloxicam for a month I’m a few days in and the pain is getting worse instead of better. It was better Friday. I’ve been dealing with it this coming Friday for 3 weeks. I need to it go away as I start my next semester on Monday. 

I’ve taken cyclobenaprine today. I’m allowed to take 3 a day, but they don’t help the pain either. Just make me sleepy and stay in bed napping all day. I took one 2.5 hours ago and I’m having so much pain right now it’s hard to get up and go bathroom. 

It’s a chronic pain so ER does nothing. Morphine is the only pain med that helps but I’m not about to take that either. I took myself off all pain meds and muscle relaxers 3 years ago. Just taking it now because of such a long and harsh flare up. Had morphine once in an ambulance when I was literally stuck in a chair. My back and groin wouldn’t allow me to get up so I had to call ambo and they picked me up and put me on the stretcher. I was given 3 injections of morphine but I have no idea how strong it was I just know after the 3rd one the pain finally eased and I was able to stand and walk again for a few hours. 

I’ve had several X-rays, CT scans, and one MRI and all I hear is shows nothing. They always tell me muscle strain, UTI (but urine tests showed none), or all in my head. I’ve been to the ER maybe 6 times in the last 4 years over this and everytime it’s give me pain med, muscle relaxer, and go see my primary. So there’s no point in getting any relief from ER. 

For 2 weeks I couldn’t sit up, I could only lay down, then during the last few days I’ve sat up and stood and walked some not much but some. And now today I’m almost back to square one and the damn cyclobenzaprine ain’t doing shot to help. And the once a day meloxicam is pretty useless so far as well. 

I just can’t stand it anymore. I have a loving husband and family (mom and sis) but I can’t keep having them do everything for me. It’s going on 3 weeks they are getting tired of it. 

I used an ice pack every day last week and it helped while laying down, but the ice cold muscles, well skin. Did NOTHING to help ease the pain upon trying to stand up or sit down. 

I don’t know what else to do. I’ve propped my leg(s) up, laid on one side or the other, I bent over just to try and stretch the muscles, I’ve used heating pad (that was hell for 3 minutes) turned it off rather quickly, obviously ice pack, propped up on several pillows, on no pillows under the head all pillows under the legs and this is in both legs not just one. And it is killing both hips when I lay on one it feels better but as soon as I rotate it’s searing sharp pain all over again. I’ve laid on my right side and let my right leg dangle off the bed, done the same thing on the left side, laid on my tummy (huge tummy sleeper here), I’ve even went to the other end of the bed in hopes that it had more cushion than the head of the bed. Nothing. I’ve tried sitting in my husband’s recliner that was hell. 

I’m just so fed up. I don’t know how much longer I can go with this flare up and having absolutely no relief. 

If you have any suggestions I’m all open for trying. And with taking meloxicam I can’t take any other otc meds. Pharmacist made double sure I knew that. And the doc said the meloxicam would help the arthritis pain and this flare up pain. But nothing yet and it’s the max dose of 15mg just once a day. 

I’m even changing my lifestyle diet. Going low carb-ish trying to stay under 100g of carbs a day and only 40% fat and protein. I’ve been told this should help. 

I just can’t deal anymore. Friday will start week 3 and that’s just ridiculous.","And it’s only day 2. I’m using My Fitness Pal and I’m adding what I’m eating and drinking. But what I eat doesn’t meet my macros. I’m added loads of food to the menu for today and it has me eating egg taco shell with ground beef and cheese, riced cauliflower, seasonings, then having 5 hard boiled eggs, 2 honeycrisp apples, 2 slices of Udi’s Rice flour Bread, 2tb miracle whip (out of primal kitchen), slice of deli cheese. All for dinner and now after dinner snack. 

I’m supposed to meet 2100-2800 calories she didn’t say anything about macros other than she wanted me to try the Autoimmune Protocol diet which is like paleo. 

I don’t want to have to eat the household groceries in 3 days with this lifestyle. 

Do I have to meet macros? I’m wanting to lose 160lbs in total.

Edit: ok, I’ve taken the planned foods to eat out (rice flour bread, 2nd apple, miracle whip lol). I think I’m going to spend my evening making a grocery list and a menu. Gonna continue with Pinterest searches, frugal Keto sub, and Keto recipes sub. We having tacos for dinner and I ate 6 hard boiled eggs earlier I’m quite still full. So I may not even eat tonight. If I do it will be some taco meat mixed with riced cauliflower and maybe some cheese. 

Thank you to the people who have responded and helped me out. I appreciate it.","I have up to $2500 to spend USD. I'm looking at the Surface Book 2 i7, 16gb ram, 512gb ssd. Mainly because of the rear facing camera. I will be using it in class to record lectures, but also need to be able to use it at the same time.

I would like to spend less then 2500 on a laptop, are there any other 2 in 1's that have a rear facing camera? The Surface Pro 6 is an option, but as far as I remember the camera faces down so there's no chance of recording lectures while using.

We do lots of troubleshooting routers and switches in my class and I'd like to record the lectures with approval from the professor already. I just don't want to have to purchase a external webcam as that would give me anxiety over looking ridiculous with a webcam lol.

I've found a few that are used on eBay and I might go that route, but just curious if there's other laptops with a rear facing camera? I can't find any.

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm also looking at the Lenova Yoga C930 it just doesn't have the rear facing webcam. This is fine I need a windows machine. I'll just have to pay real close attention in class. Is the Lenova Yoga C930 a good buy? I know you can actually upgrade it when time comes where as the Dell XPS 13 (also looking at) or the Surface Book 2 you can't. I'd like to upgrade it later than just replace in a few years time. So that's important as well. Almost more important than the rear facing webcam.","How the hell do you stop metformin from ruining your day, life, butt. Like wtf!

So how can I stop the shits from coming? Other than stop metformin as that’s not an option. Like if I change my diet will it stop? And if so what do I need to eat more of and less of?

He had had a stroke and literally no one has a spare bedroom and he couldn’t go home as it was a travel trailer. So I had to make the decision to put him on hospice and place him in a nursing facility. This was last 3 days of April till May 5th. Small short window. He died May 5th. 

It’s August 11th, I’m still getting the run around on his account. At first in May they told me if he went private pay and canceled the Medicaid paperwork which at the time was still months from being processed, when in fact now being told he lost eligibility 4 days before he died. Did I hear that? Fuck no. They didn’t tell me. On the 3rd I paid his entire SS check to cover his part of the bill because he was on Medicaid pending still. 

They told me when he died there would be a $250-350 refund on his check because it was more than they needed for his time there after hospice paid their part. That was if I canceled the Medicaid pending. At the time we mainly I decided to continue to try for Medicaid on his account that way we would get a bigger refund of his check that way we can pay the loan off we had to take out to pay for the funeral. Would have gotten back $800-900 which his funeral was $3500. Had to go dirt cheap. So it would have helped. 

Now August. They are telling me he owes $2500 for his time there. He was there fucking eight days, 8! Hospice paid their part except $800. Which I don’t get. So having to deal with that part as well. 

And just now I get an email from the woman in the business office telling me his Medicaid pending was ineligible beginning May 1st, I had just put the papers in 2 days prior. How the fuck is that possible. They hadn’t even been submitted yet. 

I’m seriously thinking about contacting a damn lawyer and having them deal with this b!tch. I’m done. If she tells me in the reply to the next email that I now owe them money I’m gonna go off on her so bad. I’m not paying. If anything it can come up even. We just have to keep going paying monthly on the loan for the term.

I’m just so fucking frustrated over this shit. I knew when hospice asked me if I wanted to go to this place my initial thought was fuck no. But they had the opening so we/I decided to do it. And yes all this was laid on me his step-granddaughter. His sons couldn’t care less, my mom and uncles didn’t want the responsibility. So he asked me a few years ago to be this person for him. I naturally said sure. 

We’ve sold the truck and the travel trailer but they weren’t worth much and they went towards the opening and closing of the grave apparently not related to the funeral costs. Ugh!","I have food sensitivities to Wheat, Gluten, Corn, White Potatoes, Tomatoes, Corn, Soy, Orange, Peanuts, Coffee, and Brewer’s Yeast. 

I also have chronic pain that others have noticed gets worse when I cheat on my diet. I’ve cheated quite a bit this week as I’m in bed since Friday due to a sciatic flare up. And can’t sit or stand for more than mere moments at a time. Literally, walking 10 feet to the bathroom is the highlight of my days and it’s painful as fuck. I hang onto everything if not I might fall. 

I don’t keep a food journal. I prolly should start a food journal and a pain journal to get the cause down but has this happened to any of you? Food sensitivities causing flare ups in chronic pain?","I've had a flare up and my previous doc said it was sciatica. So, I've been trying to take it easy which basically is all I can do. I've been in bed for nearly a week. I've gotten up and moved about a few times each day, but only for about 2 hours a day. Other than that my legs, back all want to give out. I have to lay on my left side with a pillow behind my back to even be comfortable.

It kind of feels like what a searing hot knife through the L5, S1 ripping through the bundle of nerves. And like the L5 S1 are grinding together. And it radiates down the sides of my legs not the back and surrounds the outside of the knees on both knees. When I try to rotate in bed using my right leg it feels like my knee is severely swollen, but it's not. 

I no longer have insurance and trying to finish up my last year of school so I also don't have a job, but trying to get one. With the flare up I'm afraid I'm going to be called into an interview and I won't be able to make it. So, I can only see the community clinic nurse practitioner which is fine. But does this sound like sciatica?

Edit: I’m using ice packs it helps while laying down but still getting up or walking it doesn’t help. I’m staying in bed laying on back and sides for the next 2-3 days only getting up to potty. But that means I have to rely on my family and that sucks because my sister doesn’t get it she doesn’t understand the pain. She has a torn meniscus, but refuses to wear a knee brace and always complains about it hurting but she still does the daily chores. I can’t just get out of bed and do things. My mom has fibromyalgia and lupus and is in bed a lot here lately, but expects me to force myself to get up and move around. My significant other works 12 hour days and can’t help unless he’s off. And he does help me when he feels like it. So I have to have my sister get me something to drink, eat, and she’s rather pissy right now cuz her husband isn’t doing what he’s supposed to be doing and she’s wasted over $10,000 trying to help him and he’s about to throw it all away so she’s not in a good mood. 

So I end up not eating much or drinking much because I don’t want to piss her off anymore. I just can’t do it on my own."

Thanks in advance for the help","Ever since I read somewhere on reddit about telling your elders how much you really appreciate them while you still can, instead of waiting until it's too late, I've realized how shitty I've been about those things.  My brother and dad have always been pretty closed guys and although we're friendly and on great terms, we just don't get into intimate conversations.  

Today, while opening holiday presents, one I received was a big heavy book about comparative religion.  I'm a science guy and nobody in my family is very devout or even close, so I was very confused.  That, plus the fact that I usually take a second to look my gift over and give genuine thanks and appreciation instead of immediately spouting my surprise and joy made my dad feel really embarrassed for giving it to me.  What happened is that he got it on accident from a badly-fulfilled order online and figured he would give it to me because I might enjoy it, but when he noticed my confusion I think he got the impression that it was a stupid gift, which made me feel bad in turn for giving him that impression.

The thing is, he got me other presents.  He got me very awesome gifts and he gave me a roof over my head, and always food to eat, and sacrificed his own earnings to live in a very high property tax area to contribute to giving me a great education, and forgave me for being the shithead teenager I was, and gave me an enormous sum of money to entirely cover four years of college (no rules, no conditions, no limits, just completely trusting me), and has taught me so much about how I would want to be a dad.  

Just recently little things like his embarrassment of his present, to my mom accidentally mentioning something about his worrying that I see him as absent/neglecting because he doesn't visit often have made me realize how much he cares about our relationship and how little I've done to really show him that I acknowledge the remarkable things he's done already.  I hate feeling spoiled or ungrateful, but I just have a really hard time breaking the reputation/atmosphere of our conversations because they're always just casual. ","Tomorrow is my 90th day.  I could just fap and start doing that weekly or something, or I could just keep going and hold out for only achieving orgasm with a sexual partner. 

I never really felt like a had a porn addiction, I was occasionally ashamed to masturbate everyday, though.  I've been single for a few years and have hooked up a few times in the past three months of abstaining from masturbation, but it's hard to know how much of that success is due to NoFap.  I guess I won't lose too much if I do end up masturbating tomorrow as I haven't noticed very significant gains, although I have kind of surprised myself with what I'm capable of.  Essentially, NoFap certainly has instilled in me that genuine sex with a partner is the true goal, but it's unclear whether eliminating masturbation causes the goal to be more attainable (it obviously is more enjoyable just like any good thing you force yourself to enjoy less often).  

Has anyone else experienced this grey area/uncertainty?  ","I use a big, fluffy duvet and don't usually keep my bed made, so when I get home I hurl my phone into the heap and watch it lodge like a bullet in ballistic gel.  I found plenty of posts about the temptation of throwing a phone off a bridge, but none about this.  ","I'm about two weeks from reaching 90 days of NoFap and no porn.  I stumbled a few times, lasting five and then twelve and then thirty-four days before this current streak.  I'm confident I'll make it, but I think it'd be pretty cool to have another person going through the same thing since I don't talk about the challenge with anyone.  ","That's what I told myself sixty-two days ago and it fucking worked.  

I started NoFap out of curiosity and failed a few times in a row, but every attempt lasted longer.  First for only five days, then two weeks, then thirty-four days (which was a new personal best) and the one time I caved after that month of not masturbating was revolutionary.  Masturbating still felt good, I'm not going to lie about that, but I could not for the life of me shake the oddness that I was feeling knowing that I was just watching a computer screen.  It had changed forever and it helped me immensely in lasting these past two months.  

I had never climaxed with another person before last night and although the release might have dampened my drive, it was worth it because I now know just what I'm holding out for.  

I have no doubt in my mind I will make it this next month to ninety days, and no matter where you are in your NoFap endeavor, realize that what you're doing will benefit you spectacularly.","I live in North Davis near marketplace and right now can hear an amplified voice coming from a helicopter saying something about a missing child

**Context:**  Every day that I have Biology lecture, I sit in almost the same place and I realized that a girl in my lecture had been doing the same.  When we first ended up sitting next to each other, I asked her about information on the chalkboard because she seemed nice and I wanted to test the waters.  We talked a bit that hour, but in every class since then, the seat next to her isn't open when I get there.  

So back to the present.  I'm walking with a friend, somewhat distracted by our conversation, when my eyes meet her eyes and that split-second thing happens when two people walk towards each other on the sidewalk.  First she saw me and questioned whether or not to say anything, probably letting it depend on whether I look back or not.  I meet her eyes and take a handful of milliseconds to recognize who she is, during which time she doesn't assume that my pause means I'm planning on ignoring her, she says Hi!  Most people I know have a very short tolerance for that silent eye contact as if any pause in saying Hi has some secret meaning.  

I should disclaim, I'm not hideous, I'm not completely devoid of friends or social interaction, I'm not obsessing over getting in her pants ASAP.  Her saying hi really put a grin on my face, though.  Something about the way she said Hi or what it meant that she greeted me.

I spend the ten minutes before getting to Biology secretly hoping that the seat next to her will be open so we might talk a bit more and all the while I don't even know if she recognizes me or sees any kind of pattern.  Today, though, I got my answer.  ","I got a bunch of flats last year and although having pumps around campus made it possible to at least get to a bike shop, I've accepted that I really should have a tire iron, a spare tube or two, plus CO2 cartridges or a small pump with me.  It's not a pricey bundle, but the whole point of the safety backup is null if it's likely to get stolen.  Do any of you use saddle bags for whatever reason, and do you find that they remain intact?  I live off campus so the bike won't be on campus more than a fraction of the day like most people.  Thanks  "
Strusork,"This post is gonna be a mess jsyk 
I've had depression since I was a kid. Started with some pretty horrible trauma caused by my father and birth-giver. I just... Dissociated through many many years of my life. Through grade k-5 I remember occasionally ""coming to"" and realizing I'm in class. Just for my mind to blank out again. Many times in detention, asking them for help on my school work just to be asked if I knew the severity of what I ""did"". 
That still scares me, I don't know what I did. I wasn't there for it. 
So that pattern continued until I left home to stay with my GFs family. I thought things would get better. I thought I'd finally be able to function with a loving caring family around me. But I just can't. I can't talk about ANYTHING. Quiet literally, I can't talk about my interests or anything I find even mildly interesting. My humor is all jacked up from my life of misery so I often get weird looks saying things I don't realize are strange. (Not anything nsfw or truly messed up. Just weird sentence structure and 'weird' interests) So I guess I just... Stopped talking to people. I never learned how to do it in the first place, it's easy to stop. But now that I want to again I literally begin to shake at the thought of it. I can't other than with these semi-anonymous confessionals. 
I don't remember when it started, but my brain is so preoccupied with the idea of killing myself that it's hard not to fantasize about it all day. I've tried therapy, but I would clam up and cry for the rest of the day. I just can't reach out to people. It's absolutely terrifying. If I can get past all the endless ""what ifs"" I don't have anything to say anyway. I stopped trying to drink myself to death, I'm picking up new hobbies, but all I want to do is die. I have a very detailed plan and I know exactly what I'd do. I've been perfecting it since I was 12. It's really all I want. A dream come true.
But I can't!!! My very kind and angelic gf would be crushed. I don't want anything to happen to her or hurt her. She's the only person I can be semi-open with and talk about things I enjoy to. But I just want to die so bad.

Tldr: neurotypical roommate says I don't stay 'engaged' enough in tabletop rpgs and I need advice on how to stay focused without burning out.
.

My roommate loves doing d&d and Im sort of obligated to play with them. They're neurotypical and already struggle understanding that not everybody has a brain like theirs. They already have some problems with the way I behave and I process info in about the exact opposite way they do, which they hate. 
.
Anyway
Everytime we play, they go for big long multihour sessions. I know it's usually 3+ hours that people usually do d&d for, but I burn out around the 2nd hour mark. By that time I typically draw or play mobile/switch games while playing so I don't entirely lose focus and have to stop outright. Before that time, I am one of the ONLY person using character voices, legit roleplaying, or doing anything but fighting. I have asked for shorter sessions but that never happens. 
.
We're starting a new campaign today and I was just lectured about staying more 'present' during games, and I tried to explain everything above but it didnt matter. It's really hard to explain the way your brain gets fuzzy and numb after too much of one thing. After these long sessions I almost always dissociate or have to sleep for the rest of the day. I have a headache and can't focus at all because staying on topic took so much work.

Mr_Jek,"I'm giving a lot of thought to taking a year out uni (my university lets you take a gap year during your degree). I have a job, so I can just work more hours, save up money to go travelling for a month or two, living in hostels and moving around like you said. Gives me time to focus on myself, what I want to do and whatever else and hopefully return to uni with a better attitude, if I decide to return at all.","I don't think I'm gonna drop completely. I think before I do something drastic I would at least defer a year and think it through long and hard. I did work my ass off to get here, I'm not gonna just drop it. And yeah like you said, I'm gonna exhaust all options before doing anything, whether that be talking go a mental health specialist of a counsellor or whatever. I just definitely think I need to DO something and take action instead of basically being a bystander in my own life. 

And yeah I meet new people really rarely. My friends all like having a close knit group, and usually the closest I get to new people are acquaintances I've not seen in ages. I want to expand a bit but like you said, it doesn't really happen beyond classes or mutual friends. 

My sister who dropped always told me I'd regret it if I ever did, and I really did see her struggle with it, so it's not something I'm taking lightly. At the same time though, it's something I feel I do need to consider if things don't go well.","I think a year off might be what I need. I want to maybe take a month out travelling, work hard enough at my fast food job I currently have to maybe get enough skills to find a better job, and really just focus on myself and what I want to do with my life. Hopefully by the end I'll have made up my mind on what I want to do in regards to the near future, and maybe find some interests. My university does let me defer for a year so I mean why not? It could help a ton.   

Thanks for the help. I think I have a clearer idea of what it is I need to do.","I have a student loan in place, if I started saving now I could probably save a couple of thousand by the summer. That's not including the fact that I do have a job, although it is in fast food so the pay's not great. Still, it's something. I'm sure if I worked hard I can get away travelling for a month or two, maybe more if I really budget. My university does let you defer, although I'd have to talk it over with the people who head my course. Hopefully I can work something out.

I feel like I'm really immature and maybe not entirely ready for travelling or whatever, but it's time to grow up a bit, and that will force me into it. And I won't spend all my time partying, even now it's not overly excessive, save for a couple of weekends that got out of hand. It happens at this age I suppose though. I feel like I just need a year to find myself, as cliché as it sounds. Figure out what I'm about, what I want to do, improve myself, and hopefully return to education with a far better mindset.","Probably the first time I realised I truly liked a girl for something more than her looks. Up until then I'd had crushes, but it was just admiring from afar. There was this girl in my class who I'd sat next to, and while I had thought she was good looking, I'd never thought of her beyond that. Anyway, she was sitting me telling me a story about how she had watched this girl pull this hilarious stressed face during in an exam, and went on to do an impression of the face. For some reason the way she told the story and her impression was like the funniest thing I'd heard. I knew the girl she was talking about and her impression was absolutely spot on. I was laughing so hard the teacher had to tell me to shut up. I distinctly remember thinking to myself 'this girl is the funniest girl I've ever met'.

That was a couple of years ago, and a bit later I ended up having a massive thing for her that I bottled up until school ended a few months back. In the end though she just didn't feel the same. Even though we are still pretty friendly now, she definitely wouldn't remember that little moment, but it really opened my eyes to what real feelings are and stayed with me.","In hindsight they do look pretty similar, but at the time I just didn't register it. I was too focused on the whole idea of her being a hallucination/Sherlock's weird trippy antics, and the fact that I 'knew' she was Culverton's daughter from the previous scene made me not pay much attention to her.

I did think E would be tied to Moriarty, Chekov's gun and everything, but I could have never predicted she has (what seems like) her own plan in motion, that she was the daughter/therapist, and that she would be Sherlock's god damn sister. It took me completely by surprise. Although I do think if I'd paid more attention to her the impact would definitely have been lessened.","Yeah the door lock is great. Up until then you're still not entirely sure who's side she's on. After all, she did help Sherlock. In my head I was even thinking it might be Irene Adler after all that had happened. But when she locked that door I knew we were dealing with something completely different.","Yeah for real. They've pulled the whole 'yeah this is the episode ending now, nothing more to see' and then hitting you with a twist before, but it still came as a complete shock. I thought it was just gonna be a scene showing how much happier John is now. Completely turned that idea on its head.",It is sometimes twins.,"For real, I've lost count of how many times I've watched it. As soon as she mentioned the secret third sibling I was on the edge of my seat. And then the twists just kept coming. I think it's genius how this woman pulled off 3 separate disguises and nobody even noticed at all. In hindsight I can kinda see it a little but it still blows my mind. And then the big reveal that she was Eurus. My mind was fucking blown wide open. And the hints were there all along. How she mentions to John that she must be reminding him of Sherlock at the start, how Sherlock has a childhood flashback when he's with her. It was there, but Like Watson, I never even considered for a second it could be a sister instead. And the way she just swapped from personality to personality, to finally being so fucking menacing in what was a 5 minute scene. Very good acting. Definitely one of the best scenes in the entire show.","Dude, holy shit. I done like the exact same thing during class one time. I was bored as shit, and like you I had kept getting deja by a lot. I have no idea where it came from, and it was years ago so my memory is a bit foggy, but I turned around to the guy next to me and said 'Rachel's gonna put her hand up in a minute and ask to go to the toilet. She's gonna be told to wait until class is over and then get all sulky.' I remember not even thinking it was that weird for some reason, and just KNOWING it was gonna happen with complete certainty. The guy next to me was astounded when it played out and kept asking how the fuck I managed to do that. I just jokingly said I'm psychic, but in reality I have no idea how I done it. I could never do it again and in all honesty at the time it just seemed like a bit of fun to me, the more I think about it the more I wonder what the hell went on that day.","Yeah I agree with everything you said. It really is like an addiction. The more you think about a person or the idea of being with them, the happier it makes you feel. At least until reality eventually dawns on you and you realise it's not gonna happen. Without that there, life just feels kinda dull and aimless. It's like it gives me some kind of meaning or something. Maybe that's a sign I need to find some other meaning besides that, but it's hard when you're trapped in that cycle.

The weird thing about the fantasies is that all the stuff I've thought about a person kinda faded away when I'm actually talking to them. If I find myself becoming attracted to a girl who I see everyday, I don't mind as much, cause I know with time around them I'll ground myself. The problem comes with girls who I don't see as often. The time in between seeing them is spent building up some image of them in my head that is just completely idealised. If I know I'm not gonna see a girl I like in a while I actually get a bit worried cause I know I'm gonna think about them too much and make things weird.

What you said about trying to escape something else hits home. I've always kinda thought this. I suppose if I really sit down and think about it I must be at least slightly depressed. I feel aimless, constantly exhausted, and often ask myself what the point of everything even is. I can spend days wasting away in my bed barely moving an inch. Above all that though, I think I'm just lonely. I have a ton of guy friends, and they're all great. I love hanging around with them, but I could never really open myself up completely to them in an emotional sense. Don't get me wrong, there are moments when we'll all open up a little, but in typical guy fashion, we'll make a joke out of it after the fact so that we're not opening up more than the minimum amount. It makes me feel pretty lonely that I dot have anyone I could just open up like that too. No deep emotional connection. I suppose I'm just always waiting for someone to fill that gap in my life.

Anyway, thanks, that did help. I'm glad at least someone can relate to this. I'm sure with time or whatever I'll become more rational and manage to ground myself. Good luck, I hope you find someone eventually! You're young too, there's plenty of time for both of us.

","I mean yeah I think if I did start dating I would definitely have an eye-opener and my attitude would change. But I've went years without a single girl wanting to date me. Maybe I've just been unlucky, but it's as if women can tell I've become too attached before I make any sort of move and they decide before that point that I'm not a relationship prospect or whatever. ","18, and maybe I'll be the same eventually. Right now I take almost every little thing as a potential sign. Like the other night I met this girl who we share a mutual friend with while we were at a bar and she kept laughing really hard at my jokes, and we'd catch each other laughing and laugh even harder. Then at the end she gave me a hug that seemed to go on for longer than it really had to. I walked away thinking maybe she liked me a little, when in reality we were both just a bit drunk and having a good time. Things would probably be easier for me if I just assumed girls thought I was a dumbass.",I'll do that. Eternal Sunshine is definitely in my top 5 now.,"As much as it sucks, it is nice to know it works both ways I suppose lol.","Hahahaha I suppose you're right. I really do try my best to spend time away from her, but cause everyone my age go to the same places usually at the weekend it's inevitable we're gonna see each other unless I just don't go out. And when I see her it just takes me back to square one. It's really bad. I'm hoping eventually I just reach the stage where I see her and don't feel like that anymore, but it seems like at his point that's gonna take a long time.","When you watch the full first season, without spoiling anything, it makes it pretty clear this isn't the typical police procedural. Things don't turn out how you'd expect them to. ",Most likely with my track record of reading signs from girls lol,"When I first brought it all up with her (the 'talking about standards' thing I mentioned), she was saying how she didn't want me to think she was really that easy, and that you've got to have standards, which I obviously agreed with. She does genuinely seem like a cool person though. She's really friendly, and before all this I'd talked to her a couple of times and remember actually thinking to myself how easy she was to talk to.  I want to get to know her rather than just having sex, cause in all honesty I'm not as into that as most guys. I just thinks it's more fun if there's something there beyond physical attraction. She just seems like the type of girl who's always looking for a relationship but will only actually  get involved if she thinks it's really worth it. Either way, best if we get to know each other first.","At this point? Nah, we've literally talked to each other a handful of times. A bit of flirting and shit still kinda has to happen to keep things interesting and let it build a little. If I make a move now she might just think it takes all the fun away or whatever. Girls minds work in weird ways.",Thank u young erection,"It's definitely not a catfish lol, that's the first thing I thought of, but it's definitely her. I will bring it up with her next time I'm working just to be safe.","Well yeah I mean sure, but it's still a kind of awkward situation having people try to force you both together I suppose, regardless of how you feel.",I suppose you take that chance whenever you start something new with anyone though. It's a part of life. You've just got to hope you eventually find someone who isn't gonna leave you in that way. I'm sorry that happened to you though man.,"Thanks! And yeah I think so. She's a really nice person, really funny, I wouldn't have liked her in the first place if she wasn't. But I know if we were to keep talking right now it would just lead to me liking her more, but also resenting the fact that things didn't turn out the way I wanted. That's not fair on either of us. Honestly for now I'm just gonna let whatever happens happen. If she really is desperate to talk, she will. I think time apart is definitely the way to go though.","In all honesty my life isn't that interesting and definitely not something to get hooked on hahahaha, but I talked to her today. I kinda sat in class wondering how best to strike up a conversation with her after that night, and then at the end as I was leaving she just walked up to me and said hey. We walked with each other for a couple of minutes. We didn't have much time but we just talked about that night and I was explaining to her I had got pretty drunk and ended up with a killer hangover in work the new day (forgot to mention this in the post). Basically just breaking the ice I suppose. It's really nice to have a friend at college now if nothing else.",I don't know if I'd quite call it new love. I'm excited to possibly get to know her I suppose though. She seems like a really cool girl.,You're welcome.,"It's no problem man. I really thought I would never get over this girl, and to some extent I still think it will be hard. But you'll make it through man. You'll find something that will get you through."

It's hard when I live in an apartment with my brother and sister in law. So I have almost no authority,How did you do it? Or am I SOL until I move out? Lol,"I live in an apartment complex. Every so often I see a chair sitting out by the dumpster. One day, there is a paper bag on the chair and a car drives up to it, gets the bag and leaves. 
I still see the chair outside every week","I have had a similar situation. I am also a twin, and I was raped by some guy at a party when I was around 17 years old. The party was hosted by my twin when we were house sitting. This dude had tried sleeping with me before and creeped me out but I don't remember mentioning it to my twin. Anyway, he assaults me and my sister just thought it was consensual despite me telling her otherwise. My bf at the time also didn't believe me. So he dumped me. For a few years following the incident my twin kept a friendship not only with my rapist but my ex who didn't believe me behind my back. What really helped was just me confronting my sister and even telling her that i was uncomfortable with her being friends with them on Facebook. She obviously knew keeping a friendship with them was wrong so she obliged and apologized. My advice is that all you can really do is just make it clear that it bothers you and refuse to see her until the relationship is over. She should come to her senses","I agree. I studied special education and in the program they heavily push inclusion because people with disabilities are extremely misunderstood, and that stems from isolating people with disabilities. If students are raised in a normal environment with kids with disabilities then it will be normalized. Not to mention beneficial for everyone. Example:https://youtu.be/CtRY_1mZWWg","Possibly. I could see if my husband wants to at least approach it with text because, like I said, it gets emotional and nothing gets resolved. But it would probably be more effective in person I think",I hope that it doesn't have to come down to that with us. But I think maybe refusing to see her with stepdad there would be a start for us. MIL obviously needs treatment to for staying with that man. So maybe she needs some tough love and it's about time,I agree. I think we're gonna have to set some boundaries and just refuse to visit if he will be there. This has been going on for too long already. Of course it will ultimately be my husband's decision but maybe MIL needs some tough love,"I agree with you, I think that is good advice. I believe DH needs to set boundaries and follow through instead of just having emotional conversations with his mother. More action needs to take place. I apologize that you had to eventually stop talking with your dad but I'm sure it was the right decision for you","Yes, I agree. She is very manipulative of all her kids. She seems so blinded by her self-pity that she often refuses to acknowledge her children's emotions and it's not fair. Her children are all adults now too so it needs to stop","Thank you for your advise and I apologize for what you and your family have went through. I think that I will discuss this with DH and just essentially tell him to put his foot down. He has attempted to discuss this with his mother but they both get emotional and nothing is resolved. At the moment, things don't need to be resolved but something needs to change and I'm hoping that we can come up with some boundaries if anything","MIL is a kind-hearted woman but often fails to see her mistakes. So, MIL's husband is my husband's step dad. He has severe mental illness and is an alcoholic and MIL keeps making excuses for him. I know that she doesn't love him but I think she remains in a relationship with him because she is scared of being alone. They have been together around 10 years. Here are some of the things step dad has done: has been abusive to his step children verbally and physically, posted nudes of his wife on Facebook calling her a ""slut"", stole thousands of dollars in checks from his stepson (Not husband) while he was in basic training, neglected several farm animals including 2 horses to the point where they all starved to death, and has been fired from his work for being intoxicated. There are probably other things but I think that summarizes it. Despite this, MIL is still with him. 

The other day MIL texts my husband and says something along the lines of ""step dad is feeling depressed and it would be nice of you to spend some time with him/help cheer him up"". My husband was obviously insulted by this and got angry with MIL. MIL got defensive and made for an awkward weekend.. I had even been pressured by MIL to have a relationship with him by feeling guilted into inviting him to our wedding. I don't really know what to do at this point. I know husband and MIL need therapy but no action has been taken. I'm honestly feeling a bit of resentment towards her at the moment for the immense amount of stress and abuse she allowed on my husband and I'm wondering if no contact would be good for us at the moment. Advise is appreciated.",Yoga. Even just simple stretching. It gets my mind off of things even if it's just for a short amount of time,"I don't think it's just teenagers. However, I feel like teenagers are more likely to confuse being sad as being depressed just because they don't know better.

She and her husband have taken thousands of dollars from each of her kids because they ""owe"" her from things they did when they were teenagers.

hookrapids,"I haven't read anything, that is this relatable, maybe ever.

I've also been very kind for all my life, and I've always put others needs way ahead of my own ones. An example of this is, how it's usually hard for me to compete in games, such as cardgames, because if I'm winning I start to feel awfully bad for the ones that I'm playing against, and I usually intentionally let them win, If this happens.

Ever since I had an existential crisis a few years ago, where I came to The conclusion that nothing really matters, and that I should just try to experience as many good feelings as I could, I've sort of lost my soul.

I've become depressed, and I've also started to view problems as jokes, so I just laugh at my shortcomings, problems, etc..., cuz nothing matters right? I've also been let down by mean and uncaring people so many times, that I've been trying to avoid helping others, which really hurts me deep down. I've also been convinced, that a male with such  characteristics doesn't really fit into this world, which gets me even more lost.

Now I'll be turning 17 in a few months, and the next year will be the most important one yet, for my future. The thing just is, that I'm just too lost, confused, foggy, depressed, apathetic, lonely, etc..., That I just can't face the future anymore.

Summer vacation will end in a few days, and I'm supposed to go to school again after that, which I just can't see myself doing. To drown my despair I've just been binging on anything that gives me a large and easy dopamine rush. Luckyly exercise occasionally Falls under that category, so I atleast haven't completely lost my physical health, like I have my mental one.

My one question is how to post that one work experience. Should I just say 2018-2019? I didn't work there for most of the year, though.","No, that makes sense. I struggled with the wording because the projects were just assignments (ie. Final projects for a class).

The Nobel Prize Application was a final project for an Object-Oriented Programming class. We were given a dump of a database of Nobel Prize winners, and the project was to convert that database into a user interface that allowed a user to look up a winner based on certain things, such as their name. The user interface also filtered the display of winners on the screen based on things such as the category won, place of birth, etc. 

The Contract-Contractor Application was a final project for a Software Engineering (ie. Methodologies) course. We worked through a really quick Agile development cycle, where we talked to a ""client"" (our prof). We created an application that entered Contractor info into a user interface, which took that info and stored it into a database. We also had an email component, where the application  could send emails when a contract (which was collected in the Contractor info) was close to being terminated.

I'm not quite sure how to word those, though, especially concisely. Or if they're decent projects to begin with. But they did teach me new skills at the time. Maybe I should create projects that have better real-life uses?","I don't have a quote, but I think about all the things I'm grateful for until I fall asleep. Some days I have to really try, but that's okay.","Thank you for the tips! Does the thread type count? I mean, should I pick silk thread instead of cotton?","That's a good point. I will definitely do that. I've heard that silk doesn't forgive, so I wondered if I should pick a different fabric instead.","I don't have a gauge of the difficulty of this project, and how long it may take. I pick up stuff like this easily. I can also change the robe to not a silk robe, if that's easier.","I got downvoted for saying that news outlets can be biased, no matter for what side once. I'm still not sure why.","I realize that it's partially my fault, but people didn't seem to care about supporting each other. My self-esteem really took a nosedive, especially since everything became a competition over things I didn't really care about. I learned to care about and compete over things that didn't really matter to me personally. I don't know why I cared so much.","Interesting. I would've thought that it would've been a nice detail to add, but oh well

I would've maybe thought that she didn't have a scar because of cure materia or something, but then I remembered that Zack has a scar on his cheek. So I don't know lol","On her front torso area, where Sephiroth slashed her during the Nibelheim events.

I absolutely LOVE the remake's character designs, don't get me wrong. I was just curious.","I'll definitely see about learning d3, that sounds super helpful. I haven't covered Tableau formally, but I have done data mining, doing an entire project on it. I used Power BI and MS SQL Server for it, though.

You actually made me laugh out loud 😂","I currently have a flat top for my ""roof"". Any way to put a telescope there? Or does it have to be outside, on ground level?",Did you find that it was a lot of time grinding to study and work on projects and apply for jobs? I think I got overwhelmed because it seemed like it would take a few months to even just finish a project or certification,"After my technical interview, it hit me that I really needed to study. They asked me questions on the programming fundamentals and questions from all over my degree, including Computer Security, OOP, and Algorithms. While I wasn't terrible at these courses the first time around, I still felt like I needed a refresher.

However, my web programming skills were really poor, so I had also planned to study web programming classes and work on making a web app for my resume.

On top of that, I need to actually apply for jobs. I'm not looking for anything crazy, just a software dev job where I can get my foot in and actually start learning about the field. I don't even live in the US so I'm not even considering Silicon Valley.

Any suggestions? I'm getting overwhelmed at how much I need to do. It doesn't help that I'm a little slow at learning and doing things in general. I also can't be doing this constantly because I'm generally a worse programmer if all I am doing is programming, so I need breaks to be doing other things.","I am unemployed, so I've been looking at going to social events for my field to try to get a job. Issue is, I feel really stupid talking in those circles, so I clam up and don't speak. There were even incidents where I tried to force myself to speak to get over it, and it either sounded like an idiot (would say things wrong or fumble over my words constantly), or worse, sound like a jerk trying to say something, but I ended up saying something offensive instead.

I'm nervous for usually the entire event, and it's affecting my ability to communicate properly. What can I do to get myself calm enough to be somewhat coherent at these things?","Thanks, that helps. I'll probably just ask. I find that googling sometimes confuses me. I've had times where I googled to try to understand something, and misunderstood what it was. So I sounded like an idiot talking about it. I guess that's where my social anxiety comes from, but you're right. People always aren't assholes about it, and if they are, then I'll move on.","I am actually quite okay with talking to my team daily, and I understand. I work pretty hard to make sure my work progress is communicated, and I've had practice with my previous jobs.

I do have a problem with feeling quite stupid whenever I'm in tech social circles, though. I feel like I don't understand them most of the time. Do you have any advice for that? I feel especially embarrassed because I'm a CS grad and should know these things, but I don't.","I've been applying for jobs and after I sent an application (cover letter and resume) I got the reply that my application email was ""aggressive"".

I'm not quite sure what this means. It was for a education-focused company, so I can see my cover letter being somewhat cheesy, and perhaps a bit formal, but I was confused at it being called ""aggressive"". I had multiple people look at my email and cover letter and they were equally confused.

I did notice that tech job postings tended to be less formal. Am I supposed to be less formal, generally? As in, I'd be making jokes in my cover letter and/or application email?","Thank you, that's helpful. I didn't think to lock buildings to certain sims.",I noticed a lot of tiny homes or apartments or condos all built on one lot when I'm watching YouTube builds. Can multiple families/households be on one lot? Or will you have to create one large household consisting of multiple families?

Lot of dogs dropped daily in the dead in then roam to Tc Jester,When did it eventually stop?,She came from an owner surrender to a Pet Resort. So she was at a nice place.  I’m hoping with time she gets better.,"Background:

We just adopted a 55-lb setter/lab mix, 9 months old, spayed 2 weeks ago. She has been at our home with our other dog for a week now. They get along GREAT. No issues there at all. 

Poor girl has urinated in the house almost everyday since we got her.  She knows to pee and go outside as well. It is so odd.  She drinks a ton of water, not strange for a large dog.  We have narrowed it down to mainly happening in the evening. She gets restless.  One night we let her out multiple times an hour and she successfully peed outside every time.


Also to note,  she doesn’t have any accidents in her crate overnight. 

We suspected UTI so got a test done that came back negative but the sample was diluted.  So the vet decided to put her on antibiotics just Incase.  She has panties/diapers and even going in them now.  It leaks through sometimes spreading around the house.  

 Could this be behavioral? Is it in relation to the spaying?  Overactive bladder? Anxiety?  Major health issue? We are baffled. We need help bc it’s pretty stressful. 

Thanks in advance.","That we were thinking too. We initially thought some Setter, which caught our attention, but I think you’re right!",Well it’s only been a week since we have had her so I don’t think her true colors are shining yet.

However, now I’m working on him to come when called.  Example: playing in the front yard with a neighbor dog, running around chasing, having a blast. They stay in the yard very well.  But when a passerby comes by or someone walks out of their house. He runs after them, no aggression, just curious. Worried about potential cars etc and he won’t listen when called. Even though he does know his name.

What tent brand/model is that? ,www.GusLeagues.com,Does anyone know how long it takes for CBD oil to truly take affect? ,Good idea. And yes it was a feline specific vet behaviorist. ,"My 1 year old tuxedo cat has been battling hyperesthesia for 4-5 months now. We spoke with a behaviorist first, no change. He’s been on fluoxetine (1mg), no change.  Then gabapentin (50mg) no change. I am wary of going 100 mg for his daily life so I asked about CBD chews.  

He’s now on cbd chews (RxVitamins brand) and taking a chew once in the morning and once at night.  It’s been 3 days, no change. 

Desperately, in search of some suggestions. He’s difficult to watch him attack himself daily. Thankfully no injuries, yet.  I felt it was anxiety driven, but now I’m thinking it maybe something more severe. Anyone have experience with this rare syndrome? ",Looking for similar advice,LOL adorable

Maybe look into Keto diet ( i personally follow it right now).

And please please do not relapce and stay strong brother.","yep. thats the goal for me too.  i m going to accompany nofap with internet detox and meditation + reading for my brain calmness . i remember when i was a week without access to the internet i felt like the king of the world mentally. but now i just sink my time on youtube and twitch. 

cheers. stay strong.",thats good. stay strong.,"dont think of relapcing as getting back to square one or 0%. if you consistently start having 5 days streaks it is already much better then masturbating every day. Then if you relapce every 10 days for example- it is only 3 times a month - which is 27 times less then 30 times a month (if you would have masturbated every day). You see? Then if you relapce once in 30 days - that means that you went a whole month controlling yourself. I think this is how you grow your streak.

Of course - it would be wonderful if you could immediately hit 90 days mark from the first try - but i think it is necessary to be cautious and rational about those things and not beat yourself up after a relapce. Instead try to analyze what led you to relapce - and try not to repeat the same mistake next time. 

Wish you luck and willpower. Stay strong, brother.",damn dude. if NoFap helps with acne - i am all in!!,OMG. 150+ days. we need to make it happen.,"yes. absolutely agree. in 5 years you will think - ""why didnt i do it 5 years ago, i was so much younger"". as they say - the best time to do something was 10 years ago, the second best time to do something - is NOW.",thank you. i also hope that it will become better after some time.,thank you very much. i decided that i will try dairy free keto for some time to see how it will affect my skin.,"I m about a month into Keto and i hoped that once i stop consuming sugar and carbs my skin Acne condition would improve. And while breakouts are not so often as before i still have this problem and somedays it even gets worse. I noticed that when i fast for 48 hours it seems like my skin heals a little 

So does the problem lie in Dairy? I almost associate Keto with Cheese and butter and cream. It would be hard to do Keto without dairy products... Any reccomedations on the topic?","proud of you ,man!",lets do it
MrMohawk13,"Sorry if this gets long. This is hard for me.

I have been having a few really bad days recently. For example; I planned on calling my mom today to ask her about something I've been having an issue with. I've had some anxiety about it. Both calling her and the subject of the call. When I got up this morning I couldn't get out of bed. It took the massive need to use the bathroom for me to get up. Now I'm thinking about any other way I tackle this issue/ delay it (I know I shouldn't delay it). Now I feel like I can't do anything today.

On to the actual point. My whole life I've basically been lying about being okay. I've been doing it for as long as I can remember. It's most likely because of my not so great childhood. Now it's mess up a lot of my life. I've tried to hold myself to being open several times but then I fall back into my fake fine-ness. I always just end up tell people what I think they want to here.

I had a twisted perception of them before where I thought they were a risky pet as I thought they were ""thorny"" and aggressive if that makes any sense. But this one looked  up at me for the longest time which prompted me to offer my hand for some reason (guess it was too inviting). I was surprised when it crawled up without hesitation and it showed so much character when it was looking around at my family and posing for pictures. It suddenly pouncing on my chest and crawling up to my face was a bonus. So now my question is, especially for keepers within Southeast Asia, what is the easiest species beginner species both to acquire and care for? And how long do they usually live (I'm a sentimental guy and might not be able to handle the heartbreak of losing a pet so quickly).

TrappedInaBocks,"I feel like life is just a big game of distracting yourself so you don’t give up and kill yourself, or at least that’s what my life feels like.

I keep trying to set specific goals and forcing myself to do them hoping that maybe after this I’ll be happy, but it’s yet to work.

I’m super isolated and have no way of not being isolated. I feel as though I should just quit trying and give up. 

If I didn’t have my dog I would 100% kill myself, I’m still at about a 60 to 80% on a day to day basis, though there’s days it’s less.

It’s just extremely exhausting to feel worthless and unloveable all of the time and can’t really find a healthy way of coping with it.",He has a sign in the office listing the insurance they currently fly take (I used Ohip so I can’t really help you much) even if you don’t do the consult you can call his office and ask which insurance they work with.,"I originally had a boost in sex drive (I’ve always had an annoyingly high sex drive that never matches up with anyone so I used to wish to just lose it ... well recently that’s kind of happened.

I’ve been dealing with a lot of mental health stuff, but I’ve been way worse off mentally before at least I thought and still had the same crazy sex drive.

Right now it’s almost next to none. On the bright side I wanted to decrease or altogether stop my porn consumption and this seems to be doing the trick. 

I just am unsure if it’s normal. I know I’m depressed, but I guess I’m just not used to having this much of a decrease due to depression.

Sorry for the long rambling post, I’m concerned, but also kinda of relieved. I’ve felt undateable and undesirable since my breakup almost 2 years ago and if my sex drive doesn’t come back maybe I can just write off that part of life.","I usually do that, I don’t think I did it properly that time because of the way my scrubs fit in that area (I didn’t really press on my body just kinda pressed on the fabric).","I did, thank you I knew swelling could occur for awhile, but naively didn’t think about this in regard to peeing while at work.

I made it through, the diluted water trick people recommended helped and now I know to try to bring extra scrubs if possible.","Lol thanks for the reassurance, I know part of it was because my scrubs were tied too tight because 1.gained weight during recovery and 2. They used to fall off when I’d put anything in my pockets.

I diluted with water and honestly am thankful the majority of people around me have medical grade masks on and it’s a hospital, so I can always let the blame of the pee smell shift onto some unsuspecting patient.",Thank you!,"I’m not sure if it’s from the way I went to pee, if it’s from swelling or a worsening stricture but I shook and “milked” my dick after peeing, but forgot to let it go straight down (I usually do this to make sure no drops come out).

Instead of a bit of leakage a huge spot is now down the front of my pants. They’re dark luckily, but I have no replacements and can’t wear normal pants as it’s a hospital. 

I’m more concerned that there’s something wrong with me but also embarrassed. No one knows I’m trans here and even if they did saying “hey I pissed my pants” is a bit embarrassing.

I don’t know if 11 weeks was too soon but so far I’ve walked 16000 steps (my normal work day is 20k plus) I’m just paranoid I have a stricture and embarrassed.","I’m not getting defensive, just annoyed cat your general tone of “I studied this therefore things cannot skew from this perspective”. That type of thinking is rooted in classist systems that hold academia to a higher standard than lived experience.

I’m not saying that I expect what situations I’ve dealt with to be the only kind I deal with when navigating dating other men, I am simply voicing my frustration at the circumstances I’ve ALREADY dealt with. 

Simply wanted to vent and maybe have someone listen, but if you wanna keep throwing statistics at me go right ahead.","I didn’t choose to be either so your phrasing is a little problematic.

I never said I’d look bi/gay after coming out, but clearly I will if I’m openly dating a dude.",I wish I could do this as a shift worker,"I didn’t say it was the majority ... also even with your PHD doctorate in gay dating is it factoring in differing cities, towns, etc?

3. You don’t know my parents so how about you don’t speak for them. No sperm donor was mentioned. My dad literally thinks phalloplasty allows biological kids which is his own issue.

4. I am on dating apps not Grindr, again don’t assume you know everything.","Thanks, I think a lot of trans people who are openly trans or perceived as trans by the general public despite hormones find it easier to be out as gay because they don’t have the experience of being perceived as a straight cis man.

For years I had people saying I was in the wrong bathroom or asking if I was a boy or girl before T. Getting stared at for holding a girls hand. It’s been almost 9 years of freedom from that shit so forgive me if I don’t feel like jumping back into society’s shitty comments and questions (that last bit isn’t directed at you just how I feel about being out).",Yea but guys always try to shame people into coming out or meeting parents. I don’t want anyone to meet my family even if I had a family myself and I know that isn’t going to fly with most.,"While that may be your experience, the majority of men I’ve dated in the past have been in open relationships that I later found out weren’t open. Same with friends I’ve had in “committed” relationships. 

I’m not saying every single gay man cheats I’m just saying the preference for multiple partners is rampant.","I just woke up from a series of dreams where I was going on dates with multiple people, 1 was with a woman and 2 were with men. The dreams were so good I kept forcing myself back to sleep even though I fell asleep super early.

At first I thought I was enjoying them so much because I’ve been super depressed over my ex (it’s been over a year and just haven’t gotten over her and I usually dream of her). It was nice to get a break from thinking we were still together then waking up alone. I’ve also been depressed because I only have one friend who will hang out with me during the pandemic (I live alone) and I just spent 2 months alone after lower surgery.

I had a realization on waking by up that part of the reason I can’t get over my ex is that I’d then have to admit I’m probably gay. I’ve never had a spark with a dude, but I’ve also been very closed off to dating men. I only ever hook up in secret and even friends I have sometimes don’t know.

I don’t think I’m mentally in a spot to date rn (I’ve been trying to to get over my ex/start dating someone so I’ll have company during the pandemic, but I really think I need to work on my hobbies and fitness. 

My other problem is I have a looot of internalized homophobia (with gay men not women). I also enjoy moving through society as a straight man it’s been years since I’ve had someone look at me funny and being openly gay would just start that up again.

Lastly, I don’t want to tell my parents. It may sound weird, but they’re very old school and are set on me being a straight dude having a family, etc. I know no one is going to want to deal with dating a closeted guy.

These are just a lot of feelings I’m having, part of me is relieved because this means I can finally let go of my ex, but another part of me if afraid because I’m very monogamous and that’s not as prevalent in the gay male community, as well as the rest of the above mentioned issues.

I don’t want to be gay, I thought I was just bi, but I’m starting to think I was wrong.","I’m 28 and just scheduled myself to do my written drivers test. Congrats, you’re not alone!",Confused do you want meta or phallo,I threw out 95% of my sentimental stuff. It’s just stuff and half the people who gave it to me aren’t in my daily life anymore anyway.,Also had stage 1 in September and dealing with the same disappointment.

The one thing I did feel was anxiety about hurting it during the healing process. 

Sensation is still developing as it takes awhile for the nerves they micro surgically attached to connect, I can orgasm through stimulating my natal anatomy (it’s buried in the base of my new penis so I just jerk off like normal.

It feels like any body part, warm, part of my body etc. I’m still on the fence about the erectile device as there are some risks associated, but looking forward to testicular implants and glansplasty (basically like circumcision so you have a defined penis head).","Flaccid, unfortunately it will be the same size erect, I’m pre erectile device, it will just get thicker.

laradrekko,"
I was always extremely introverted as a kid. So when I was raped at 9, I pushed the memory as far back as humanly possible. I don't know if this is a thing... But I completely forgot about it. He was my best friend's older brother. Their family and mine were pretty close. Being minority immigrants means that the circle was small and people stuck together. I was scared all the time. Fortunately a few years after that we moved to my parents' home country. Unfortunately, I'd entered my adolescence. I had no friends, I was ugly, awkward and absolutely alone. I did terrible at school and inadvertantly robbed myself of my life ahead as well. I'd forgotten about the rape though. Till I was 14. Precisely on my 14th birthday there was rape story that broke the headlines. It made things a lot, lot worse. I became insomniac, got from enormous panic attacks, and was bullied for everything+my pathetic looks and body. I told my mother, after 8 years when I was 17. She asked me to never mention it ever again to anyone. She said it's not a big deal. That it (the act) wasn't rape anyway since the guy was only 12-13 and no way could he ""get it on"" or ""get it out"". I'd spent 8 years bottling everything. I spent the next years doing that as well. Everytime I did something ""teenagery"", she'd always say ""you're behaving this way because of The Incident, get over it. Happens to every girl."" Of course I did terrible in school. I couldn't become much of anything. In grad school things became worse. At 21 I moved away from everyone. This was supposed to be my new beginning. But it got worse than ever. Because of my nature as well as the depression, I spent two years absolutely alone being unable to connect. I both liked and was afraid of relationships. I diagnosed myself with anxiety and depression. At 23 was my first kiss. He cheated on me. My feelings of self worth dissolved even more. I knew I was too ugly to be with him. He proved it. My mother recently attended my rapist's wedding. I was never able to connect with people. I have many friends but I'm the option that they have to take. My career isn't going very well. I think the best thing to do now, would be to give up and die. I don't see the point of a life in complete shambles.

TL;DR- I'm ugly, alone, career less and don't deserve anyone. Being raped and depressed, I want to give up. Please don't sugar-coat what you think. I need the truth. Thank you so much for your time!","He's like ugh, the dad jokes have already started loll",That's what I was going for! Thanks!!

ViralMedia_Reddit,"Hello,

I don't often do this but right now I have no one to speak to really. Today I woke up and my partner said she does not love me anymore and she left, She is somewhat manipulative and abuses me mentally but I continue to love her (I don't even know why). We have been together for almost 13+ years and have two children. One of which is 9 months old and this close to Christmas it's extremely difficult.

I work from home and since the lockdowns I have noticed myself shutting away in my office, stressing about my business and with the very little friends due to abusive natures in the past (from her) I resort to playing a lot of games. Gaming was my escape and I could forget about everything.  The shutting away has made me and the now ex become distant which I believe has got me into this situation.

I really don't know where to go from here, I have lost everything - I still love her despite her abusive nature and I miss my kids greatly.

How does someone bounce back from this?","Can confirm! My office used to be nextdoor to HR and I could hear the conversations, they simply didn't care. It's probably the same across other places too.","How much people brown nose managers, directors and the fake friendliness.

cheers. stay strong.",thats good. stay strong.,"dont think of relapcing as getting back to square one or 0%. if you consistently start having 5 days streaks it is already much better then masturbating every day. Then if you relapce every 10 days for example- it is only 3 times a month - which is 27 times less then 30 times a month (if you would have masturbated every day). You see? Then if you relapce once in 30 days - that means that you went a whole month controlling yourself. I think this is how you grow your streak.

Of course - it would be wonderful if you could immediately hit 90 days mark from the first try - but i think it is necessary to be cautious and rational about those things and not beat yourself up after a relapce.

1) does your anxiety latch onto things. like. for example your anxiety is latched onto this thing and it won’t let go until you find another thing to latch onto and then the previous one will completely deteriorate.
2) mines latched onto my swearing atm. i have recently sworn at lot more to the point nearly every sentence involves a swear word and thinking about it disgusts me a tad coz i used to hate swearing and believed that it was wrong. i’m scared of swearing in front of my strict parents   any tips on how to stop swearing or at least stop to a decent amount ? 
3) i am going to be seeing a psychiatrist soon for the first time. is there anything i can do to prepare myself. i’m also going to be assessed for a form of OCD. but any tips i could use or questions to ask please

I THINK i’m going to have a therapist at the same time. but i’m scared that my psychiatrist won’t diagnose me with HOCD,i’ve got a psychiatrist that i’m going to see for the first time next month. and i’m really nervous. because i’m going mainly for severe anxiety and depression but i’m going to mention the HOCD thing and i’m so incredibly scared that they are going to tell me that i haven’t got it. ahhhhh what do i do ?

allisdust0,"Hello.

I'm not sure if this is the right place. And it will be long, sorry about that.

I've been feeling like this since my late teens. I'm 31 now, and I just feel that I'm going nowhere with my life.

On the surface everything seems quite decent.

I'm married, we have 2 kids, all my family members are healthy for their age. My sex life isn't dead. My health is good, I have a job that pays the bills and a bit on top, I have no financial debt. Our marriage was a bumpy road, but it did settle down okay. I think I'm succeeding in keeping most of my neuroticism to myself without passing it to my kids. I dare say that I'm the most involved in their lives. And they do seem to love me in return, and want to spend as much time as possible with me, surprisingly.

However, I just can't stop feeling like a complete fraud and utter failure.

I'm constantly sleep deprived. Not terribly so, getting around 6 hours daily, but still. By the time I put kids to sleep and finish the chores it's already past bedtime, and i find myself presented with two options: go to bed immediately and fail to fall asleep due to stress of feeling that I wasted another day of my life, or do something dumb and moderately entertaining until I feel tired enough to fall asleep (but by that point I've already lost 2-3 hours of sleep). As a result I'm having trouble focusing and remembering things, *which impacts my ability to learn new things*, importance of which will be seen later.

My job does pay the bills, and I even like it on most days. But it doesn't pay that well and is not super stable. At the same time it's the best I can expect with my qualifications/experience. I don't think I can learn anything new to change my occupation - I have neither enough energy or mental capacity to do so, not to mention my packed schedule.

I try my best to be a decent parent, and on most days I do well. However in the past there were a handful of times where I lost my temper and I was just as awful  as my own parents were.  It was BAD, with yelling and several times with spanking. Unlike my parents I apologized and did my absolute best to reassure my kids that what happened was entirely my fault and that I had no right to act in a way I did. I did everything I could imagine a responsible adult do to salvage the situation and minimize the damage. It seems to be ok. But some damage will probably resurface. I absolutely hate myself for putting my kids through some of the stuff my parents put myself through in their time. I swore to myself, to avoid exactly that, am constantly vigilant of my own temper, and I succeed in keeping it in check 99.95% of the time. Doesn't make it any better, since it's not 100% though.

I used to exercise regularly, even frequently. But since my older kid started going to school, exercise slot on my time-table was taken by helping him with homework assignments, of which they get an impressive amount for first graders.

I used to have hobbies. I used to be able to somewhat relax (even at the cost of sleep time) doing something harmless, like reading or playing videogames. For a few years I was pretty serious about drawing. I was an aspiring artist. That was the only period in my life when I was *aspiring*\-anything. But I burned out hard. Haven't been able to creatively recover for 3 years to this day. My imagination is dead. My aspirations are comatose. I don't enjoy anything that I do, I can't relax or distract myself with dumb stuff. Everything is bland and pointless.

I used to fantasize that in a few years after my kids grow up, I'll finally be able to turn off my phone, by a ticket to Siberia, trek - oh so deep - into the forest and open my carotid arteries there - to bleed out in peace, my remains never to be discovered. But even that fantasy I had to bury, reflecting upon how much distress that could potentially bring to my family. With even that little selfish fantasy taken away I just keep living my life lost, hollow, hopeless. I'm too tired, time starved, busy and stupid to fix anything. I don't see things getting better for me, because, if we're being more objective here - they already are going pretty well. But for me it doesn't feel like it.

I tried getting professional help before (2015-2017). But where I live anything relating mental health is still largely stigmatized, and mental healthcare system still holds fast by the idea that best mental help is in heavy sedation and isolation. When I was receiving professional help was, interestingly enough, the only time when I seriously considered acting upon my suicidal ideation, and the drugs were stripping me of the ability to work and perform other duties, taking away my last refuge of burying myself in work and chores. So I guess I'll just stick with venting on the interwebs. 

No, actually, if anyone got some outside perspective to offer or maybe some sound advise - it would be very welcome. But if not, that's just fine too.

With this I conclude this disjointed unnecessarily long monologue.

Have a nice day!","It would be best if she'd just say it plainly. Even though I'll refuse, the honesty and openness is flattering and I'd appreciate the sentiment.

But we upped our communication since then, so it's no longer an issue and no need for faking anymore.",Sounds fun.,"I don't really know what to share.

I knew we were going to have sex, my first time, not her first, I knew the theoretical part, had two condoms at the ready, was moderately sexually excited and had manageable performance anxiety.

It was my first sexual experience with a girl (but not first otherwise), but I wouldn't call it especially emotionally striking.

There were no experience of universe expanding or collapsing on me, no electric shock or some other extreme experiences I've read other folks describing.

Just something that didn't happen to me before that and then it happened and life went on.

Sorry if that was somewhat disappointing to read 😆","Very anxious, but otherwise unremarkable.","It's just fine without sparks, butterflies and all the other romantic mumbo-jumbo. But I guess it might depend on initial expectations.","Good start would be not to be part of the problem of expecting all men to only think about sex all the time and be able to perform on demand.

For me it's usually the opposite: when horny my brain works fast, and if I manage to steer the thought process away from sex, then I can enjoy a mentally productive state for a while.

But after an orgasm, no matter the cause — into the pit of depression I go. Best case scenario my mind is just blank and dull, but usually it's worse.","My wife doesn't like it, that's why.",6 months plus a few days,"Had the same experience.

This is how my wife describes the situation as well. But when it comes to practical implementation it's always ""gosh, lemme sleep you animal"". I don't think she's dishonest when she talks about it while awake, but it's entirely different matter when she actually finds herself in the situation.","Let me bounce off your post a bit.

I usually masturbate good distance away when my wife is sleeping. She gets upset when if she catches me and says I should've woken her up. However throughout the 11 years of our marriage every time I'd gently try to wake her up (and I know better not to disturb sleeping people if they told me prior that they had a rough day/were tired) , she'd just make a few irritated, annoyed comments and go back to sleeping, so to wake her up means to be left both unsatisfied and in ruined mood.

Masturbating while your partner sleeps is viewed by quite some number of people as disrespectful or borderline infidelity. While I personally strongly disagree with this take, it's still something to be aware of.",Honestly this.,"31M sexually active since 17, married for 11 years.

I can totally relate. 

I'm still self conscious about the same stuff, and it never abated one bit.
However, I don't care at all if my wife would do something like that — I wouldn't pay it much attention at all. But I can't apply it the other way around.

I always expect to be judged, I always believe I *deserve* to be judged.","31m. Not really a turn on. I don't really *care* what other people wear or don't wear. None of my business or interest. I usually briefly ""scan"" a person head to toe, may mentally point out a detail or two ""this is a fancy coat"", ""this fella has is really tall"", ""I find these shoes mismatching the overall style"", ""this woman is not wearing a bra"", ""this lad has a pocket knife in his jeans"". But I'll probably forget about it in a second or two — just not enough hecks given. 

If someone goes out of their way to make a statement about your choice of clothing, it's their problem. And if attracting attention was your plan all along, then good job. But I think there are a lot more people who just don't care about such little things.

Dress however is comfortable for you.",...and even more guilt and apologies afterwards.,"Year is 1999, I'm 10, my parents be like:

So I'm mostly self sex-educated, I guess.",Sing Ave Maria loudly.,"You're adult now, if your parents still try to control you like you were 12 years old, it's about time to think about breaking off. It doesn't matter how strict they are, it's none of their business, not anymore.

Now that I’m off that medicine it has improved a lot my main symptoms are just yellowish stool and lots of gas production from the bacteria. Also have occasional mild abdominal pain from gas that will go away within a couple minutes. 
I have yet to take my antibiotic I have been prescribed because I don’t really feel like going through die off right now but I suspect I’ll be back to normal once I do.

Once I realized how big a problem the weight loss was I started making sure I was eating at least 2500 calories a day and I’ve came back up to 145. I feel that it is harder to gain weight with sibo however. I’ve eaten over 2500 calories everyday for 3 months straight and I’m only up 10 lbs.

Also in regards to the diet, try to find something that’s high calories that you can tolerate that may be outside of what is allowed. For me I can eat as much fried chicken and French fries as I want. It may not be healthy but it’s an easy 1000+ calorie meal I can have several times a week.

That’s the absolute worst it seems like it’s never gonna end when you’re in the middle of one. You’re right it’s probably not a good idea. I think my last 3 flare ups were after a night of heavy drinking but that was 20+ drinks of beer whiskey bourbon etc so not really “clean” alcohol.
